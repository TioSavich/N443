**Alignment of Problem Set Tasks to 1st Grade Kentucky Math Standards**

| **Original Problem** | **Relevant KY Standard(s)** | **Notes on Standard Alignment** | **1st Grade Reformulation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **John’s candies:** “John had 8 candies, he eats 3 of them. How many candies does he have now?” | KY.1.OA.1 ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,2)) | This is a basic “taking from” subtraction word problem with result unknown, using small numbers. It addresses the standard by requiring addition/subtraction within 20 in a real-life context. Students must interpret the situation and subtract to find the remainder, directly aligning with solving word problems as per KY.1.OA.1. | **John’s candies (adapted):** “John had 15 candies. He ate 4 of them. How many candies does he have now?” (Still a one-step “take away” problem, but with slightly larger numbers to remain within 1st grade range.) |
| **Birthday guests:** “There are 8 children around the table for Dorothy’s birthday, and 3 of them are drinking juice. How many are not drinking juice?” | KY.1.OA.1 ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,2)) | This is a part–whole scenario (“taking apart” a total). Students have the total number and one part, and must find the other part by subtraction. It aligns with KY.1.OA.1, which includes **putting together/taking apart** situations within 20. The problem builds number sense by having students recognize the relationship between a whole (8 children) and its parts (drinking vs. not drinking). | **Party guests (adapted):** “There are 18 children at a party, and 5 of them are eating cake. How many children are *not* eating cake?” (Same structure with a total and one part given – still solved by subtraction within 20.) |
| **Juanita’s money:** “Juanita has just been given $3 by her grandmother. She now has $8. How many dollars did she have before?” | KY.1.OA.1 ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,2)),<br>KY.1.OA.4 ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,addend%20problem.%20%28MP.2%2C%20MP.7)) | This problem requires finding an **unknown starting amount** (“add to” with start unknown). Students know the final amount (8) and the amount added (3), and must determine the initial amount. This aligns with KY.1.OA.1 by using addition/subtraction within 20 with an unknown in the initial position. It also exemplifies KY.1.OA.4, since solving it involves understanding subtraction as finding an unknown addend (knowing that if 3 added to something gives 8, that “something” is 5) ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,addend%20problem.%20%28MP.2%2C%20MP.7)). | **Juanita’s money (adapted):** “Juanita has just been given $4 for her birthday. Now she has $13. How many dollars did she have before?” (Different numbers, same unknown-start structure. Students must recognize that this can be solved by 13 – 4 to find the initial amount.) |
| **Marbles lost:** “Robert had 8 marbles before playing with Ruth. He now has 3 marbles. *What has happened during the game?*” | KY.1.OA.1 ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,2)) | This scenario presents a **change unknown** situation in a subtraction context. Students have to figure out how many marbles were lost (or given away) – the change – given the starting amount and ending amount. This meets KY.1.OA.1 by requiring subtraction within 20 in a word problem. It reinforces understanding of the relationship between the initial quantity, the change, and the result (here, recognizing that an unknown number was taken away from 8 to leave 3). | **Marbles lost (adapted):** “Ryan had 15 marbles before playing a game. After the game, he has 6 marbles. How many marbles did he lose during the game?” (A more explicit question for first graders, still a “change unknown” problem – they must find the number subtracted.) |
| **Susan and Claire:** “Susan has $3 in her pocket. Claire has $8. How much less does Susan have (than Claire)?” | KY.1.OA.1 ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,2)) | This is a **comparison** problem asking for the difference between two quantities. Comparing amounts (“How much less?” or “How many more?”) is one of the addition/subtraction situations first graders should handle ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,2)). To solve it, students subtract 3 from 8 (or find the difference) to see how much more one has. This aligns with KY.1.OA.1 as it involves subtraction within 20 in a real-life context, building understanding of comparative difference. | **Claire and Susan (adapted):** “Claire has 15 marbles. Susan has 9 marbles. How many more marbles does Claire have than Susan?” (Uses a larger pair of numbers but the same compare structure. Students find the difference 15 – 9, strengthening the concept of “how many more”.) |
| **True/false equation:** *“Is the equation 6 = 5 + 2 true or false?”* | KY.1.OA.7 ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,3)) | This task checks students’ understanding of the **equal sign** as meaning *“the same amount as”* on both sides of an equation. According to KY.1.OA.7, first graders should determine if addition/subtraction equations are true or false ([1st Grade Math. Kentucky Academic Standards Kentucky Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/kentucky-standards#:~:text=,3)). In this case, they must evaluate each side: 5 + 2 equals 7, which is not the same as 6, so the equation is false. The problem goes beyond simple calculation – it targets the idea that an equation’s two sides represent equal quantities only when the statement is true. | **True/false equation (adapted):** *“Is the equation 4 + 3 = 3 + 4 true or false?”* (Another example for first graders to judge. They must recognize each side totals 7, so the statement is true. This reinforces the understanding that order doesn’t matter in addition and both sides represent the same value when an equation is correct.) |
| **Shape attributes:** “Jack drew a square and then turned his paper so the square looked like a diamond. He says it’s no longer a square. Is he right?” | KY.1.G.1 ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=KY,to%2C%20number%20of%20sides%20or)) | These geometry problems address **defining attributes** of shapes (such as number of sides, lengths of sides, angles) versus non-defining attributes (such as orientation or color). KY.1.G.1 expects students to distinguish between them ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=KY,to%2C%20number%20of%20sides%20or)). In the original scenario, a square is rotated – students must know it’s *still a square* because the defining attributes (4 equal sides, 4 corners) didn’t change, showing orientation is not a defining feature. This aligns with the standard’s focus on understanding what makes a shape what it is. | **Shape attributes (adapted):** “Jill drew a triangle and then colored it blue. Is it still a triangle after she colors it blue? How do you know?” (In this version, color is the non-defining attribute. A first grader should recognize it’s still a triangle because it still has 3 sides – color or size **don’t** change the shape’s identity, addressing the same standard in an age-appropriate way.) |
| **Sharing a pie:** “Juan had 12 candies, he ate 1/4 of them. How many candies did he eat?” | KY.1.G.3 ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=Coherence%20KY,Describe%20the%20whole%20as)) | The original problem involves finding one-fourth of a set of objects, which goes beyond typical first-grade expectations (fractions of **sets** are usually introduced later). The concept of fourths/quarters *is* introduced in Grade 1 but in terms of shapes. By adapting the context to a **partitioned shape**, we align it with KY.1.G.3, which has students partition circles and rectangles into halves and fourths and use those terms ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=Coherence%20KY,Describe%20the%20whole%20as)). This meets the standard by having students consider equal shares of a whole. | **Sharing a pie (adapted):** “Lily cut a pie into 4 equal slices. She ate one slice. What fraction of the pie did she eat?” (A first-grade-friendly context for fourths: students learn that one slice out of four equal slices is **one-fourth** of the pie. This reinforces the idea of quarters in a visual, accessible way.) |
| **Class survey:** *“In a class survey of favorite seasons, 6 students chose Spring, 10 chose Summer, 4 chose Fall, and 8 chose Winter. Which season got the most votes? Which got the fewest? How many more students chose Summer than Fall?”* | KY.1.MD.4 ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=KY,table%2Fchart%20with%20up%20to%20three)) | The original question involves four categories (the four seasons) and multiple questions, making it somewhat complex for first graders. The adapted version limits the categories to three and focuses on basic interpretation, in line with KY.1.MD.4 which expects first graders to **organize and interpret data with up to three categories** ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=KY,table%2Fchart%20with%20up%20to%20three)). Students still practice analyzing the data (identifying most/least and comparing counts), aligning with the standard’s emphasis on drawing conclusions from simple charts or survey results. | **Class survey (adapted):** *“Sarah asked her class about their favorite fruit. 8 students chose apples, 5 chose bananas, and 7 chose oranges. Which fruit was the most popular? How many more students liked that fruit than the least popular fruit?”* (This version uses three categories and asks students to find the maximum and make a simple comparison, which is appropriate for first grade data analysis.) |
| **Counting sequence:** “Sam counted: 108, 109, 200… Did he count correctly? If not, what number should come after 109?” | KY.1.NBT.1 ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=KY,objects%20with%20a%20written%20numeral)) | This task highlights understanding of the **counting sequence and place value**. The original scenario shows a common error when crossing a hundred (jumping to “200” after 109). First graders are expected to count forward within 120 from any starting number ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=KY,objects%20with%20a%20written%20numeral)). The adapted problem uses smaller numbers but the same idea – checking if students know what comes after a number ending in 9. This aligns with KY.1.NBT.1 by ensuring students can continue the count correctly and recognize patterns in our base-10 system (e.g. after 59 comes 60, not 70). | **Counting sequence (adapted):** “Sally counted: 58, 59, 70. Did she count the sequence correctly? If not, what number comes after 59?” (In this version, students must recognize the mistake and know that 60 should follow 59. It reinforces the idea of how numbers progress and tests understanding of decade transitions in counting.) |
