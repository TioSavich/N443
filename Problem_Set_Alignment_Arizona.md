| **Stacking Cups:** “How Many Cups?” – *In class we solved the How Many Cups? problem. The first three cups were 8.1 cm, 7.6 cm, and 7.1 cm. The last cup is 2.6 cm.* (Designed for 5th grade 5.NBT.B.7). <br>*Task:* Determine the total height when stacking cups.  | - **Standard:** 2.OA.A.1 – Solve one- and two-step addition/subtraction word problems within 100 ([1  2.OA.A.1 Math.2.OA.1 2.OA.A.1  2.NR.2.3  2.OA.1  2.OA.1  2.OA.1  2.OA.A.1](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=6213#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%202)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Second graders practice **repeated addition** by adding the height of each cup. This builds number sense with whole numbers and relates to measurement (height). <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Each cup is 5 cm tall. If you stack 4 cups, what is the total height of the stack?”* (Students add 5+5+5+5 to find 20 cm, reinforcing addition within 100.)  | - **Standard:** 3.OA.A.3 – Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations with equal groups or measurement quantities ([1  3.OA.A.1 Math.3.OA.1 3.OA.A.1  3.PAR.3.6  3.OA.1  3.OA.1  3.OA.1  3.OA.A.1  3.OA.A.1  2  3.OA.A.2 Math.3.OA.2 3.OA.A.2  3.PAR.3.2  3.OA.2  3.OA.2  3.OA.A.2  3.OA.A.2  3  3.OA.A.3 Math.3.OA.3 3.OA.A.3  3.PAR.3.3  3.OA.3  3.OA.3  3.OA.3  3.OA.A.3  CC.2.2.3.A.4   M03.B-O.3.1.6   M03.B-O.3.1.7   3.PAR.2.2  3.PAR.3.4  3.PAR.3.7](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=5748#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%203)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Third graders can recognize this as a **multiplicative** situation (equal cup height added repeatedly). They might use repeated addition or multiplication to find the total height, connecting to the concept of equal groups in multiplication. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Each cup is 4 cm tall. How tall will a stack of 6 identical cups be?”* (Students can compute 4×6=24 cm, or add 4 six times, demonstrating multiplication as repeated addition in a measurement context.) | - **Standard:** 4.OA.A.3 – Solve multistep word problems using the four operations, including problems where remainders may need interpretation ([](https://www.azed.gov/sites/default/files/2016/12/Math%20Final%2004Fourth%20Grade%20Standards%204_2_2017.pdf?id=58546f52aadebe13008c1a2c#:~:text=4,a%20fraction%20of%20the%20divisor)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Fourth graders tackle a **two-step problem**: they must add an initial value and repeated increments. This encourages algebraic thinking by recognizing the pattern (first cup has a different height contribution than subsequent cups). <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“One cup is 7 cm tall. Due to overlap when stacking, each additional cup adds only 2 cm to the height. If you stack 10 cups, what is the total height?”* (Students must do 7 cm + 9×2 cm, a multistep calculation. This aligns with multi-step reasoning and introduces the idea of interpreting a pattern, preparing them for linear functions in later grades.) |
| **Equal Groups (Candy Bags):** *Maria has 4 bags of apples with 6 apples in each bag. How many apples does she have in total?* (Illustrates equal groups multiplication) | - **Standard:** 2.OA.C.4 – Use addition to find the total number of objects arranged in equal groups (rectangular arrays) up to 5×5, and write an equation to express the total as a sum of equal addends ([IXL - Common Core second-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/common-core/math/grade-2#:~:text=%2A%20,a%20sum%20of%20equal%20addends)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** This problem allows second graders to practice **repeated addition** for equal groups, laying the foundation for multiplication. They will add the same number multiple times and can even write an addition equation to represent the total. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Maria has 4 baskets with 5 apples in each basket. How many apples are there in all?”* (Students solve 5+5+5+5 = 20, and can write the equation 5+5+5+5=20. This reinforces addition skills and introduces the structure of arrays/equal groups.) | - **Standard:** 3.OA.A.3 – Solve word problems using multiplication within 100 involving equal groups ([1  3.OA.A.1 Math.3.OA.1 3.OA.A.1  3.PAR.3.6  3.OA.1  3.OA.1  3.OA.1  3.OA.A.1  3.OA.A.1  2  3.OA.A.2 Math.3.OA.2 3.OA.A.2  3.PAR.3.2  3.OA.2  3.OA.2  3.OA.A.2  3.OA.A.2  3  3.OA.A.3 Math.3.OA.3 3.OA.A.3  3.PAR.3.3  3.OA.3  3.OA.3  3.OA.3  3.OA.A.3  CC.2.2.3.A.4   M03.B-O.3.1.6   M03.B-O.3.1.7   3.PAR.2.2  3.PAR.3.4  3.PAR.3.7](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=5748#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%203)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Third graders will directly apply **multiplication** to this equal-groups problem. It reinforces their understanding of groups of objects and translating that to a multiplication fact, a key third-grade skill. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Maria has 4 bags of apples with 6 apples in each bag. How many apples does she have in total?”* (Students solve 4×6=24. This one-step multiplication problem aligns with 3.OA.3 by using the equal groups interpretation of multiplication.) | - **Standard:** 4.OA.A.2 – Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison ([1  4.OA.A.1 Math.4.OA.1 4.OA.A.1  4.NR.2.2  4.OA.1  4.OA.1  4.OA.A.1  2  4.OA.A.2 Math.4.OA.2 4.OA.A.2  4.OA.2  4.OA.2  4.OA.A.2  15.c  4.NF.B.3d Math.4.NF.3d 4.NF.B.3.D  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.3d  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.B.3.d  4.NF.B.3.d  16.c  4.NF.B.4c Math.4.NF.4c 4.NF.B.4.C  4.NF.4.c  4.NF.4c  4.NF.4.c  4.NF.B.4.c  4.NF.B.4.c  M04.A-F.2.1.4  M04.A-F.2.1.7   CC.2.2.4.A.1  M04.B-O.1.1.1   M04.B-O.1.1.2   M04.B-O.1.1.4   4.NR.2.2  4.NR.2.3  4.CAR.7  4.CAR.9  4.CAR.10](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=481#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%204)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** The fourth-grade version emphasizes **multiplicative comparison** (“times as many”), which is a more advanced use of multiplication. Students must understand one quantity in terms of a multiple of another, rather than just equal groups in one set. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Maria has 6 apples. John has 4 times as many apples as Maria. How many apples does John have?”* (Students recognize this as 4×6, and solve for 24 apples. This phrasing “4 times as many” aligns with 4.OA.2, requiring understanding of multiplication as a comparison.) |
| **Sharing Pizza (Fractions):** *John ate 2/3 of a pizza and Mary ate 3/4 of another pizza of the same size. How much pizza did they eat altogether?* (Addition of unlike fractions – beyond 4th grade level) | - **Standard:** 2.G.A.3 – Partition circles and rectangles into two, three, or four equal shares; describe the shares using words like halves, thirds, fourths ([26  2.G.A.2 Math.2.G.2 2.G.A.2  2.G.2  2.G.A.2  27  2.G.A.3 Math.2.G.3 2.G.A.3  2.GSR.7.3  2.G.3  2.G.3  2.G.A.3  MA.2.FR.1.1  1.GSR.4.3  2.GSR.7.3  2.GSR.7.4  2.NPV.6  2.NPV.7  2.GM.8](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=1623#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%202)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Second graders are not adding fractions yet, but they **understand simple fractions** as equal parts of a whole. This adapted problem focuses on partitioning and naming fractions (a foundational concept for later fraction arithmetic). <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Four friends share a pizza equally. What fraction of the pizza does each friend get?”* (Students recognize the pizza is divided into 4 equal parts and each friend gets **one-fourth (1/4)**. They learn vocabulary like “quarter” and understand that 4 of these make the whole pizza, addressing 2.G.3.) | - **Standard:** 3.NF.A.1 – Understand a fraction 1/b as one part of a whole partitioned into b equal parts; understand a fraction a/b as a parts of size 1/b ([](https://www.azed.gov/sites/default/files/2016/12/Math%20Final%2003Third%20Grade%20Standards%204_2_2018.pdf#:~:text=3,2)). Also addresses 3.NF.A.3b (simple equivalent fractions). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Third graders deepen their **fraction understanding** by reasoning about fractions of the same whole and equivalence. The adapted problem has them compare two expressions of the same portion, reinforcing the concept that different fractions can be equivalent when referring to the same whole. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“John says he ate 4/8 of a pizza. Mary says she ate 1/2 of an identical pizza. Did John and Mary eat the same amount of pizza?”* (Students realize that 4/8 and 1/2 are the same amount ([26  2.G.A.2 Math.2.G.2 2.G.A.2  2.G.2  2.G.A.2  27  2.G.A.3 Math.2.G.3 2.G.A.3  2.GSR.7.3  2.G.3  2.G.3  2.G.A.3  MA.2.FR.1.1  1.GSR.4.3  2.GSR.7.3  2.GSR.7.4  2.NPV.6  2.NPV.7  2.GM.8](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=1623#:~:text=Partition%20circles%20and%20rectangles%20into,not%20have%20the%20same%20shape)) ([13  3.NF.A.1 Math.3.NF.1 3.NF.A.1  3.NR.4.1  3.NF.1  3.NF.1  3.NF.A.1  3.NF.A.1  14.a  3.NF.A.2a Math.3.NF.2a 3.NF.A.2.A  3.NR.4.3  3.NF.2.a  3.NF.2a  3.NF.2.a  3.NF.2.a  3.NF.A.2.a  3.NF.A.2.a  14.b  3.NF.A.2b Math.3.NF.2b 3.NF.A.2.B  3.NF.2.b  3.NF.2b  3.NF.2.b  3.NF.2.b  3.NF.A.2.b  3.NF.A.2.b](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=5788#:~:text=Understand%20a%20fraction%20,a%20parts%20of%20size%201%2Fb)), since 4/8 simplifies to 1/2. This develops understanding of fraction equivalence and the idea that fractions can be represented in different ways.) | - **Standard:** 4.NF.B.3.d – Solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions referring to the same whole and having like denominators ([1  4.OA.A.1 Math.4.OA.1 4.OA.A.1  4.NR.2.2  4.OA.1  4.OA.1  4.OA.A.1  2  4.OA.A.2 Math.4.OA.2 4.OA.A.2  4.OA.2  4.OA.2  4.OA.A.2  15.c  4.NF.B.3d Math.4.NF.3d 4.NF.B.3.D  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.3d  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.B.3.d  4.NF.B.3.d  16.c  4.NF.B.4c Math.4.NF.4c 4.NF.B.4.C  4.NF.4.c  4.NF.4c  4.NF.4.c  4.NF.B.4.c  4.NF.B.4.c  M04.A-F.2.1.4  M04.A-F.2.1.7   CC.2.2.4.A.1  M04.B-O.1.1.1   M04.B-O.1.1.2   M04.B-O.1.1.4   4.NR.2.2  4.NR.2.3  4.CAR.7  4.CAR.9  4.CAR.10](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=481#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%204)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Fourth graders practice **adding fractions with like denominators** in a real-world context. This builds fraction computation skills aligned with fourth-grade objectives (joining parts of a whole that have the same-sized pieces). <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“John ate 2/5 of a cake and Mary ate 1/5 of the same cake. What fraction of the cake did they eat together?”* (Students add 2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5 of the cake, demonstrating fraction addition with like denominators ([1  4.OA.A.1 Math.4.OA.1 4.OA.A.1  4.NR.2.2  4.OA.1  4.OA.1  4.OA.A.1  2  4.OA.A.2 Math.4.OA.2 4.OA.A.2  4.OA.2  4.OA.2  4.OA.A.2  15.c  4.NF.B.3d Math.4.NF.3d 4.NF.B.3.D  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.3d  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.3.d  4.NF.B.3.d  4.NF.B.3.d  16.c  4.NF.B.4c Math.4.NF.4c 4.NF.B.4.C  4.NF.4.c  4.NF.4c  4.NF.4.c  4.NF.B.4.c  4.NF.B.4.c  M04.A-F.2.1.4  M04.A-F.2.1.7   CC.2.2.4.A.1  M04.B-O.1.1.1   M04.B-O.1.1.2   M04.B-O.1.1.4   4.NR.2.2  4.NR.2.3  4.CAR.7  4.CAR.9  4.CAR.10](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=481#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%204)). This problem reinforces that the parts must refer to the same whole and uses a sum of fractions within one whole.) |
| **Geometry – Shapes & Perimeter:** *A rectangle has a perimeter of 30 cm. One side length is 8 cm. What is the length of the other side?* (Finding unknown side given perimeter – multi-step reasoning) | - **Standard:** 2.G.A.1 – Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes (e.g., a given number of angles or equal faces); identify common shapes like triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, and cubes ([Identifying Sides and Angles - Two 1st, 2nd or 3rd Grade Geometry ...](https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Identifying-Sides-and-Angles-Two-1st-2nd-or-3rd-Grade-Geometry-Math-Centers-9177315#:~:text=,Identify%20triangles)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Second graders learn basic **shape recognition and attributes**. Instead of perimeter (not a 2nd-grade standard), the adapted task focuses on identifying shapes by side count, reinforcing geometry vocabulary and recognition skills. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Draw a shape that has 6 sides. What is the name of this shape?”* (Students draw a six-sided figure and identify it as a **hexagon**. This addresses recognizing shapes by number of sides, aligning with 2.G.1, and builds a foundation for understanding properties of shapes before introducing perimeter in later grades.) | - **Standard:** 3.MD.D.8 – Solve real-world and mathematical problems involving perimeters of polygons, including finding perimeter given side lengths or finding an unknown side length ([25  3.MD.C.8 Math.3.MD.8 3.MD.D.8  3.GSR.8.1  3.MD.8  3.MD.8  3.MD.8  3.MD.D.8  CC.2.4.3.A.6   M03.D-M.4.1.1   MA.3.GR.2.3  MA.3.GR.2.4  3.GSR.8.1  3.GSR.8.2](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=270#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%203)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Third graders are introduced to **perimeter** as the distance around a shape. They practice computing perimeter and also finding missing side lengths using subtraction, which develops problem-solving with addition and subtraction in geometric contexts. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“A rectangle is 5 cm long and 3 cm wide. What is the perimeter of the rectangle?”* (Students calculate 5+3+5+3 = 16 cm. This reinforces the concept of perimeter by adding all side lengths ([25  3.MD.C.8 Math.3.MD.8 3.MD.D.8  3.GSR.8.1  3.MD.8  3.MD.8  3.MD.8  3.MD.D.8  CC.2.4.3.A.6   M03.D-M.4.1.1   MA.3.GR.2.3  MA.3.GR.2.4  3.GSR.8.1  3.GSR.8.2](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=270#:~:text=Solve%20real,same%20area%20and%20different%20perimeters)). For extension, the teacher could ask, “If another rectangle has a perimeter of 16 cm but one side is 4 cm, what is the other side?” to gently introduce finding unknown sides.) | - **Standard:** 4.MD.A.3 – Apply the area and perimeter formulas for rectangles in real-world problems, including finding unknown side lengths ([](https://www.azed.gov/sites/default/files/2016/12/Math%20Final%2004Fourth%20Grade%20Standards%204_2_2017.pdf?id=58546f52aadebe13008c1a2c#:~:text=4,See%20Table%202)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Fourth graders use **formula-based reasoning** to solve a multi-step geometry problem. They must apply the perimeter formula (P=2*(L+W)) and work backwards to find a missing dimension, which integrates algebraic thinking with geometry. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“A rectangle has a perimeter of 30 cm. If its length is 8 cm, what is its width? Show how you know.”* (Students use the perimeter formula: 30 = 2*(8 + W). They solve 2*(8+W)=30 ⇒ 8+W=15 ⇒ **W=7 cm**. This problem aligns with 4.MD.3 by requiring application of the perimeter formula and solving for an unknown side ([](https://www.azed.gov/sites/default/files/2016/12/Math%20Final%2004Fourth%20Grade%20Standards%204_2_2017.pdf?id=58546f52aadebe13008c1a2c#:~:text=4,See%20Table%202)), reinforcing multi-step problem solving and understanding of linear measurement.) |
| **Multi-Step Money Problem (Problem Solving):** *Alice has $20. She buys a toy for $7 and a book for $5. How much money does she have left?* (Combine addition and subtraction in a real-life context) | - **Standard:** 2.MD.C.8 – Solve word problems with money (dollar bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies), using $ and ¢ symbols appropriately ([Money - Learning Farm](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=1620#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%202,dimes%2C%20nickels%2C%20and%20pennies)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** This problem engages second graders in a **two-step word problem** with money, requiring addition then subtraction. It reinforces coin/bill values and making change, which builds both number sense and practical skills. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Alice has $20. She buys a doll for $7 and a book for $5. How much money does she have left?”* (Students first find the total cost $7+$5=$12, then subtract from $20 to find $8 remaining. This addresses 2.MD.8 by using money in a word problem and practicing addition/subtraction in context.) | - **Standard:** 3.OA.D.8 – Solve two-step word problems using the four operations; represent these with equations and use reasoning to check answers ([8  3.OA.D.8 Math.3.OA.8 3.OA.D.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.D.8  3.OA.D.7  10 Math.3.NBT.1 3.NBT.A.1  3.NR.1.3  3.NBT.A.1  3.NBT.A.1  CC.2.2.3.A.4   M03.B-O.3.1.2   M03.B-O.3.1.6   M03.B-O.3.1.7   3.CAR.7](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=5749#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%203)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** The third-grade version increases complexity by including **multiplication** in a multi-step problem. Students must perform a multiplication and an addition (total spending), then a subtraction, aligning with 3.OA.8’s requirement to tackle two-step problems with any operations. It also encourages writing an equation with a variable for the unknown. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Alice has $20. She buys 3 packs of markers for $2 each and a notebook for $5. How much money has she spent, and how much does she have left?”* (Students calculate the cost of markers 3×$2 = $6, then add the $5 notebook cost for a total of $11 spent. Next, they subtract $11 from $20 to find $9 left. This exemplifies a two-step problem (multiplication then subtraction) and students can represent it with an equation like 20 – (3×2 + 5) = 9, fulfilling 3.OA.D.8 ([8  3.OA.D.8 Math.3.OA.8 3.OA.D.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.8  3.OA.D.8  3.OA.D.7  10 Math.3.NBT.1 3.NBT.A.1  3.NR.1.3  3.NBT.A.1  3.NBT.A.1  CC.2.2.3.A.4   M03.B-O.3.1.2   M03.B-O.3.1.6   M03.B-O.3.1.7   3.CAR.7](https://www.learningfarm.com/web/practicePassThrough.cfm?TopicID=5749#:~:text=Arizona%20Academic%20Standards%3A%20%203)).) | - **Standard:** 4.MD.A.2 – Use the four operations to solve word problems involving money, including problems with decimals ([](https://www.azed.gov/sites/default/files/2016/12/Math%20Final%2004Fourth%20Grade%20Standards%204_2_2017.pdf?id=58546f52aadebe13008c1a2c#:~:text=4,and%20problems%20that%20require%20expressing)). <br> - **Meets Standard:** Fourth graders extend the money problem to include **decimal arithmetic**, reflecting real prices. This aligns with their study of decimal notation and addition/subtraction of decimals (tenths and hundredths) in measurement contexts. It also remains a multi-step problem, reinforcing the order of operations in context. <br> - **Adapted Problem:** *“Alice has $20.00. She buys a toy for $7.50 and a book for $5.25. How much money does she have left?”* (Students add $7.50 + $5.25 = $12.75, then compute $20.00 – $12.75 = **$7.25** left. This requires adding and subtracting decimals, connecting to 4.MD.2 ([](https://www.azed.gov/sites/default/files/2016/12/Math%20Final%2004Fourth%20Grade%20Standards%204_2_2017.pdf?id=58546f52aadebe13008c1a2c#:~:text=4,and%20problems%20that%20require%20expressing)). It reinforces place value understanding with money (hundredths place) and multi-step calculation in a real-world scenario.) |

Each problem above is mapped to the appropriate Arizona Mathematics Standard for the grade level, with an explanation of how the problem addresses that standard and a grade-appropriate reformulation of the problem. This ensures a balanced coverage of **number sense**, **algebraic thinking**, **fractions**, **geometry**, and **problem-solving** across 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades. The adaptations simplify numbers or concepts to match developmental levels while maintaining the core skill focus, so students build towards multi-step and conceptual reasoning in a scaffolded way.
