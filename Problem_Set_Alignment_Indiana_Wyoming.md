**Alignment of Problems to Educational Standards (Indiana & Wyoming)**

| **Original Problem** | **Relevant Standards** (Indiana & Wyoming) | **Notes on Alignment** | **Reformulated Problem (2nd Grade, Wyoming)** |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **“How Many Cups?”** – (First three cups measure 8.1 cm, 7.6 cm, 7.1 cm. The last cup is 2.6 cm tall.) *(Original designed for Grade 5 decimal operations.)* | • *Indiana:* 5.C.8 – Add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimals to hundredths ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-5-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=5,strategy%20and%20explain%20the%20reasoning)).<br>• *Wyoming:* 5.NBT.D.7 – Perform operations with decimals to hundredths ([Grade 5 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-5-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=5,and%20explain%20the%20reasoning%20used)). | Involves adding measurements with decimals (stacking cup heights), directly addressing the Grade 5 standard for decimal addition/subtraction ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-5-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=5,strategy%20and%20explain%20the%20reasoning)) ([Grade 5 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-5-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=5,and%20explain%20the%20reasoning%20used)). The problem requires summing fractional lengths (cm), which is exactly the competency expected by these standards. | **Stacking Cups (Grade 2):** *“One cup is 7 cm tall. How tall will a stack of 4 such cups be?”* (Uses repeated addition of a whole number, aligning with 2nd-grade addition within 100. The new problem targets Wyoming 2nd-grade operations with addition.) |
| **Candy Multiplication:** “Brother had 3 candies, and Sister had 6 candies. How many times as much candy did Sister have than Brother?” | • *Indiana:* 4.AT.4 – Solve real-world problems involving multiplicative comparison (use drawings/equations for “times as many”) ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-4-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=4.AT.4%20Solve%20real,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)).<br>• *Wyoming:* 4.OA.A.2 – Multiply or divide to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison ([](https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2015/2016-released-items-math-grade-4.pdf#:~:text=2012%20WyCPS%20Standard%3A%204,multiplicative%20comparison%20from%20additive%20comparison)). | A multiplicative comparison problem (“how many times more?”) aligns with 4th-grade standards. Sister’s 6 vs Brother’s 3 is a “times as many” situation, fulfilling the requirement to interpret and solve multiplicative comparisons ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-4-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=4.AT.4%20Solve%20real,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)) ([](https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2015/2016-released-items-math-grade-4.pdf#:~:text=2012%20WyCPS%20Standard%3A%204,multiplicative%20comparison%20from%20additive%20comparison)). | **Candy Comparison (Grade 2):** *“Brother has 3 candies and Sister has 6 candies. How many more candies does Sister have than Brother?”* (Uses additive comparison within 10, fitting a Grade 2 “compare” problem structure – a simpler objective for Wyoming 2nd graders.) |
| **Height Difference:** “Brother A is 166 cm tall and his sister is 67 cm. Brother B is 173 cm tall. If Brother A stands 17 cm taller over his sister than Brother B does over his sister, how tall is Sister B?” | • *Indiana:* 3.AT.3 – Solve two-step real-world problems using the four operations (use equations with a symbol for unknown) ([3rd Grade Math. Indiana Academic Standards Indiana Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/indiana-standards#:~:text=%23%203.AT.3.%20Solve%20two,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)).<br>• *Wyoming:* 3.OA.8 – Solve two-step word problems using the four operations; represent these with equations and check for reasonableness ([https://pipeline-dev.ets.org:.../wy_frq_3Md/aggregate.xml.pdf](https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2015/2014-released-items-math-grade-3.pdf#:~:text=2012%20WyCPS%20Standard%3A%203,parentheses%20to%20specify%20a%20particular)). | This problem involves multiple steps: computing A’s sibling height difference and using it to find Sister B’s height. It aligns with 3rd-grade multi-step problem standards ([3rd Grade Math. Indiana Academic Standards Indiana Academic Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/indiana-standards#:~:text=%23%203.AT.3.%20Solve%20two,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)) ([https://pipeline-dev.ets.org:.../wy_frq_3Md/aggregate.xml.pdf](https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2015/2014-released-items-math-grade-3.pdf#:~:text=2012%20WyCPS%20Standard%3A%203,parentheses%20to%20specify%20a%20particular)) (two subtractions or an equation to solve the unknown). It requires reasoning across two related subtraction steps, as expected in these standards. (It also introduces an unknown Sister B height, fitting the use of an equation with a symbol.) | **Sibling Height (Grade 2):** *“Tom is 48 inches tall; his sister is 45 inches tall. Sam is 50 inches tall; his sister is 46 inches tall. Who has a bigger height difference between brother and sister?”* (Second graders find and compare two simple differences – an accessible adaptation aligning with basic subtraction comparisons in Wyoming Grade 2.) |
| **Triangles from Lines:** “How many unique triangles can be formed by the six lines shown? (One example triangle is bolded in the diagram.)” | • *Indiana (Process)*: Math Process **PS.7** – Look for and make use of structure ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=PS,being%20composed%20of%20several%20objects)).<br>• *Wyoming (Practice)*: **MP.7** – Look for and make use of structure ([Grade 5 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-5-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=MP7%20Look%20for%20and%20make,multiply%2C%20and%20divide%20with%20whole)). | Counting triangles formed by multiple lines is not a standard K–6 content topic, but it requires structural insight. The solver must discern patterns and substructures (triangles) created by intersections – exemplifying **MP.7 (structure)** ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=PS,being%20composed%20of%20several%20objects)). The problem cultivates analytical skills in noticing geometric patterns, aligning with the practice of looking for structure in a complex figure ([Grade 5 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-5-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=MP7%20Look%20for%20and%20make,multiply%2C%20and%20divide%20with%20whole)). | **Triangle Hunt (Grade 2):** *“Amy draws a big triangle. Then she draws a line from one corner of the triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side. How many triangles do you see now (counting the big triangle and the smaller ones)?”* (This simplified task has students identify triangles in a divided shape, aligning with Grade 2 expectations to recognize geometric shapes like triangles ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=Identify%2C%20describe%2C%20and%20classify%20two,dimensional)) ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,%28Sizes%20are)).) |
| **Penny Triangle Puzzle:** “36 pennies are arranged in a triangle. What is the fewest number of moves to turn the triangle upside down, if you can move only one penny at a time? (Hint: try simpler cases like 3, 6, or 10 pennies first.)” *(Follow-up: Does your strategy work for 45 pennies?)* | • *Indiana (Process)*: Math Process **PS.1** – Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them (e.g. break problem into cases) ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,and%20look%20for%20ways%20to)).<br>• *Wyoming (Practice)*: **MP.1** – Understand the problem and explore simpler cases as entry points to a solution ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,and%20look%20for%20ways%20to)). | This open-ended puzzle emphasizes **problem-solving perseverance**. There is no straightforward content standard for moving pennies, but it aligns with Practice Standard 1: students must **understand the problem, try simpler cases, and persevere** to find the minimum moves ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,and%20look%20for%20ways%20to)). The hint explicitly encourages examining simpler cases, reflecting the MP.1 approach of breaking a complex problem into simpler parts. | **Coin Triangle (Grade 2):** *“Arrange 6 coins in a triangle. By moving just one coin, can you flip the triangle upside down?”* (A much simpler version appropriate for young students to encourage experimentation and perseverance. It aligns with fostering basic problem-solving skills in Wyoming Grade 2, even though there is no specific content standard—emphasis is on the practice of trying ideas and checking results.) |
| **Growing Dot Pattern:** “Marcy has a pattern of dots in steps. She wants the number of dots in the 20th step without drawing all 20. Find a way to get the answer and explain why it’s correct.” | • *Indiana:* 4.AT.6 – Describe a relationship between two variables; generate a number pattern given a rule ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-4-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=4,that%20follows%20a%20given%20rule)).<br>• *Wyoming:* 4.OA.C.5 – Generate and analyze patterns that follow a given rule (and identify features of the pattern not explicit in the rule) ([Grade 4 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-4-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=Generate%20and%20analyze%20patterns,the%20pattern%20that%20were%20not)). | This problem involves finding the $n$th term of a sequence (the 20th step) by recognizing the pattern or rule. It aligns with 4th-grade pattern standards ([Grade 4 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-4-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=Generate%20and%20analyze%20patterns,the%20pattern%20that%20were%20not)). Students must generalize the pattern (an implicit linear rule) to compute a later term, demonstrating the ability to extend number patterns and explain the rule – exactly as required by these standards. | **Simple Pattern (Grade 2):** *“Step 1 has 2 dots, Step 2 has 4 dots, Step 3 has 6 dots. If this pattern continues, how many dots will Step 5 have?”* (Second graders can recognize this add-2 pattern. This exercise aligns with Indiana’s Grade 2 standard for extending number patterns using addition ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2,addition%20and%20subtraction%20within%201000)). Wyoming emphasizes pattern recognition through Mathematical Practice ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,by%20place%2C%20and%20equal%20shares)) for this age.) |
| **Coin Flip Outcomes:** “How many distinct sequences of heads and tails are possible if you flip a coin… 2 times? 3 times? … 9 times (e.g. one possible 9-flip sequence is HTTHTTHTT)?” | • *Indiana:* 7.DSP.5 – Develop probability models including sample space of outcomes for simple events (equal likelihood) ([Grade7-Math-Content-Connectors.docx](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade7-Math-Content-Connectors.docx.pdf#:~:text=7,7)).<br>• *Wyoming:* 7.SP.8(b) – Represent sample spaces for compound events using organized lists, tables, or tree diagrams ([
Illustrative Mathematics
](https://tasks.illustrativemathematics.org/content-standards/7/SP/C/8#:~:text=a%20Understand%20that%2C%20just%20as,which%20the%20compound%20event%20occurs)). | Although probability is beyond K–5, this problem of listing coin-flip outcomes aligns with 7th-grade standards on **sample spaces of compound events**. The task expects students to recognize the pattern 2, 4, 8,… outcomes (powers of 2), essentially enumerating the sample space for 2, 3, or 9 coin flips ([

](https://tasks.illustrativemathematics.org/content-standards/7/SP/C/8#:~:text=b%20Represent%20sample%20spaces%20for,space%20which%20compose%20the%20event)). | **Outfit Combinations (Grade 2):** *“Sam has 2 hats (one red, one blue) and 2 shirts (one green, one yellow). If he picks one hat and one shirt to wear, how many different outfits can he make?”* (This is a basic combinatorial problem within second-grade grasp. Students can draw or list the 2×2 combinations, connecting to the idea of an array. It reinforces addition or early multiplication concept for Wyoming 2nd grade (counting combinations in a 2-by-2 array).) |
| **John’s Candies:** “John had 8 candies. He eats 3 of them. How many candies does he have now?” | • *Indiana:* 2.CA.2 – Solve real-world addition and subtraction problems within 100, in situations of adding to/taking from, with unknowns in any position ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems)).<br>• *Wyoming:* 2.OA.A.1 – Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one-step word problems in situations of adding to, taking from, etc., with unknowns in all positions ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)). | This is a simple **“taking from”** scenario (8 minus 3) within 10, directly satisfying the Grade 2 standard for one-step subtraction problems ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems)) ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)). John’s remaining candies represent the result unknown in a “take from” context, a category explicitly described by the standards. | *(Reformulated problem is already at a Grade 2 level.)* John’s scenario itself is appropriate for Wyoming 2nd graders and meets their learning objectives for subtraction within 20. |
| **Birthday Juice:** “There are 8 children at Dorothy’s birthday table, and 3 of them are drinking juice. How many children are not drinking juice?” | • *Indiana:* 2.CA.2 – (Same as above) ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems))<br>• *Wyoming:* 2.OA.A.1 – (Same as above) ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)) | A **“take apart”** (part-part-whole) problem with subtraction: total 8 children split into 3 drinking juice and the rest unknown. This fits the standard by using subtraction within 10 to find the missing part ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)). It’s a one-step scenario (“total – part = other part”) well within Grade 2 expectations ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems)). | *(Original is already a Grade 2-level problem.)* |
| **Juanita’s Money:** “Juanita’s grandmother gave her $3. Now Juanita has $8. How many dollars did she have before?” | • *Indiana:* 2.CA.2 ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems))<br>• *Wyoming:* 2.OA.A.1 ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)) | An **“adding to, start unknown”** problem: an initial amount + 3 = 8. This aligns with standards by featuring an unknown initial addend in an addition within 10 ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems)). Second graders solve it by subtracting 3 from 8, consistent with the comparing/adding situations noted in the standard (unknown in initial position) ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)). | *(Original is already a Grade 2-level problem.)* |
| **Robert’s Marbles:** “Robert had 8 marbles before playing a game with Ruth. He now has 3 marbles. How many marbles did he lose during the game?” | • *Indiana:* 2.CA.2 ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems))<br>• *Wyoming:* 2.OA.A.1 ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)) | A **“change unknown” take-from** problem: 8 → 3, asking for the change (marbles lost). This fits the one-step subtraction framework (resulting in 5 lost) within 10 ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)). It exemplifies a compare-by-subtraction scenario as well – determining how many were taken, which Grade 2 students are expected to handle in context ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems)). | *(Original is already a Grade 2-level problem.)* |
| **Susan and Claire:** “Susan has $3 and Claire has $8. How much less money does Susan have than Claire?” | • *Indiana:* 2.CA.2 ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems))<br>• *Wyoming:* 2.OA.A.1 ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)) | A **comparison (difference unknown)** problem. The question “how much less” signals a subtraction (8 – 3) to find the difference, aligning perfectly with Grade 2 standards for compare problems ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems)). It’s within 10 and requires understanding the comparative language, which is explicitly mentioned in the standard’s scope (“comparing, with unknowns in all parts”) ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)). | *(Original is already a Grade 2-level problem.)* |
| **Ally’s Marbles:** “Ally won some marbles in two games. In the second game she won 3 marbles. After both games, she has 8 marbles in total from her wins. How many marbles did she win in the first game?” | • *Indiana:* 2.CA.2 ([](https://www.in.gov/doe/files/Grade-2-Math-Standards-Dec-2020-R.pdf#:~:text=2.CA.2%20Solve%20real,are%20reasonable%20in%20addition%20problems))<br>• *Wyoming:* 2.OA.A.1 ([Grade 2 Standards](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Grade-2-Standards-2022.pdf#:~:text=2,apart%2C%20and%20comparing%2C%20with%20unknowns)) | This is an **“adding to, change (one addend) unknown”** scenario: ? + 3 = 8.
