**Alignment of Problem Sets to Missouri 3rd & 4th Grade Standards**  

| **Original Problem** (from ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf)                                                                                          | **3rd Grade Alignment** (Standard, Notes, Adaptation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **4th Grade Alignment** (Standard, Notes, Adaptation)                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Marcy’s Dot Pattern:** *“Marcy has to determine the number of dots in the 20th step… but she does not want to draw all 20 pictures and count. Find the answer and explain how you know it is correct.”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=4,see%20image)) | - **Standard:** 3.RA.E.11 – Identify arithmetic patterns and explain them using properties of operations ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,explain%20arithmetic%20patterns)). <br> - **Notes:** This problem builds **algebraic thinking** as students discern a pattern (likely a growing sequence of dots) and find the 20th term without enumerating each step. It aligns with 3rd grade expectations to recognize patterns in numbers or shapes and describe the rule (e.g. “adding the same number each time”) ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,explain%20arithmetic%20patterns)). <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Use a smaller step to keep it within 3rd grade reach. For example: *“Marcy draws a pattern of shapes: Step 1 has 2 dots, Step 2 has 4 dots, Step 3 has 6 dots. If the pattern continues, how many dots will Step 5 have? Explain how you know.”* This simpler pattern (increasing by 2 each step) lets 3rd graders practice finding and extending a pattern with addition. | - **Standard:** 4.RA.C.6 – Generate a number pattern that follows a given rule ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,that%20follows%20a%20given%20rule)) (and express the rule in words per 4.RA.C.7 ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,rule%20for%20a%20given%20pattern))). <br> - **Notes:** By 4th grade, students not only recognize patterns but **formulate rules** and extend them. Solving the 20th-step dot problem meets this standard by having students apply a rule to generate a later term. For example, if they determine the rule “add 2 dots each step,” they use it to find the 20th term, demonstrating understanding of pattern generation ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,that%20follows%20a%20given%20rule)). This fosters algebraic reasoning in a more complex context. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** Increase complexity or term. For example: *“Marcy’s pattern starts with 3 dots and grows by 2 more dots each step. Step 1: 3 dots, Step 2: 5 dots, Step 3: 7 dots… Without drawing every step, how many dots will Step 10 have? Explain the rule.”* This requires 4th graders to apply the rule (+2 each step) to reach a later term and articulate the rule (“add 2 each time”), aligning with the 4th grade focus on rule-based pattern generation. |
| **Coin Flip Sequences:** *“How many unique sequences of heads and tails are there if you flip a coin 2 times…, 3 times…, 9 times…?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=5,are%20there%20if%20you%20flip)) | - **Standard:** 3.RA.E.11 – Identify arithmetic patterns and explain them ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,explain%20arithmetic%20patterns)). <br> - **Notes:** This problem involves **number sense and patterns**. Third graders list outcomes for 2 or 3 flips (e.g. HH, HT, TH, TT for 2 flips) and observe the pattern doubling each time. It aligns with identifying patterns in outcomes (1 flip →2 outcomes, 2 flips →4 outcomes, 3 flips →8 outcomes, etc.) and encourages students to explain that each additional flip *doubles* the possibilities. This introduces multiplicative reasoning in a gentle way, consistent with 3rd grade pattern recognition. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Limit the flips to a smaller number. For example: *“If you flip a coin 2 times, there are 4 possible outcomes (HH, HT, TH, TT). How many outcomes are possible with 3 coin flips? Can you predict the number for 4 flips?”* This allows third graders to list and recognize the doubling pattern without needing to go up to 9 flips. | - **Standard:** 4.RA.C.7 – Use words or symbols to express the rule for a given pattern ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,rule%20for%20a%20given%20pattern)) (related to generating patterns). <br> - **Notes:** Fourth graders can tackle the deeper pattern here – an **algebraic pattern doubling at each step**. They should articulate the rule (e.g. “each extra flip multiplies the outcomes by 2”) and apply it. This meets the 4th grade standard by having them generate the pattern to, say, 5 or 6 flips and express the growth rule in words or an expression (perhaps $2^n$ for advanced students) ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,rule%20for%20a%20given%20pattern)). It reinforces understanding of exponential growth using multiplicative patterns, an advanced application of their multiplication skills. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** Probe a bit further. For example: *“Every time you flip an additional coin, the number of outcomes doubles. If 2 flips give 4 outcomes and 3 flips give 8 outcomes, how many outcomes will 5 flips have? Explain how you know without listing all possibilities.”* This requires 4th graders to apply the “×2” rule repeatedly (demonstrating 4→8→16→32 outcomes) and describe the rule, aligning with their ability to handle multi-step pattern growth. |
| **Brothers’ Heights:** *“Brother A was 166 cm, Sister A was 67 cm, and Brother B was 173 cm. If Brother A won by 17 centimeters, how tall was Sister B?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=a,If)) | - **Standard:** 3.RA.D.9 – Write and solve two-step word problems involving the four operations (with an unknown) ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,operations%20to%20solve%20word%20problems)). <br> - **Notes:** This is a multi-step **problem-solving** scenario. Third graders must first find how much taller Brother A is than Sister A (e.g. 166–67) and then use the fact that this difference is 17 cm more than Brother B’s difference to find Sister B’s height. While the original numbers are large, the structure aligns with 3rd grade multi-step problems using addition/subtraction. It meets the standard by requiring two operations (subtraction to find one difference, then subtraction of 17, or an equation) to reach the answer ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,operations%20to%20solve%20word%20problems)). It develops understanding of **comparative subtraction** in a real context. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Use smaller, more accessible numbers and make the comparison explicit. For example: *“Brother A is 60 cm tall and Sister A is 40 cm tall. Brother B is 65 cm tall. Brother A is 20 cm taller than his sister. Brother A stands 5 cm higher above his sister than Brother B does above his sister. How tall is Sister B?”* In this version, third graders can calculate Brother A’s difference (20 cm) and then find Sister B’s height by reducing that difference by 5 (so Brother B’s difference is 15 cm, making Sister B 50 cm). This simpler arithmetic keeps the **two-step structure** while fitting 3rd graders’ number range. | - **Standard:** 4.RA.A.2 – Solve multi-step problems with whole numbers, including variables, and judge reasonableness ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,the%20reasonableness%20of%20the%20answer)). <br> - **Notes:** For 4th graders, this problem exemplifies a **two-step algebraic thinking** task. They solve an equation implicitly: (Brother A – Sister A) = (Brother B – Sister B) + 17. This aligns with 4th grade standards by requiring multiple operations and use of an unknown (Sister B’s height) ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,the%20reasonableness%20of%20the%20answer)). It reinforces **number sense** with larger numbers and introduces an early algebra concept (difference of differences) appropriate for 4th grade problem-solving. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** The original problem is suitable for 4th grade with clear wording. For instance: *“Brother A is 166 cm and Sister A is 67 cm. Brother B is 173 cm. Brother A’s height advantage over his sister is 17 cm more than Brother B’s advantage over his sister. How tall is Sister B?”* Fourth graders would compute Brother A’s sibling height difference (99 cm), then set up an equation or reasoning to find Sister B (ensuring Brother A’s 99 cm is 17 more than Brother B’s difference) – a multi-step solution. The large numbers and the comparative language match 4th grade abilities, and checking the result fosters estimation and reasoning about the answer’s reasonableness ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,the%20reasonableness%20of%20the%20answer)). |
| **Unique Triangles Puzzle:** *“How many unique triangles are made by the six lines below? (one example triangle is shown in bold)”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=5,one)) | - **Standard:** 3.GM.A.1 – Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g. triangles, quadrilaterals) share attributes that define those categories ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,shapes%20and%20their%20attributes)). <br> - **Notes:** While counting all triangles from six lines is quite advanced, the underlying skill is recognizing **triangles** among a complex figure. For 3rd graders, this relates to identifying shapes and their attributes. It supports the standard by having students discern which formations of intersecting lines create a triangle (closed 3-sided figures), reinforcing their understanding of the attributes of triangles ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,shapes%20and%20their%20attributes)). It’s essentially a **geometry problem-solving** task that encourages careful observation and classification of shapes. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Greatly simplify the scenario. For example: *“Draw a large triangle on paper. Now draw one line inside the triangle from one corner to the midpoint of the opposite side. How many triangles can you find in the new figure?”* In this simpler task, third graders physically see a triangle subdivided into smaller triangles and can count them (e.g. 3 triangles in total). This hands-on counting of triangles focuses on the same idea – recognizing triangles – but at a complexity suitable for 3rd grade geometry. | - **Standard:** 4.GM.A.1 – Draw and identify points, lines, and line segments (and understand how they form shapes) ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,perpendicular%20lines%20and%20parallel%20lines)); *and* 4.GM.A.2 – Classify 2D shapes by properties of their sides/angles (including identifying triangles) ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20%23%23%23%23%204.GM.A.2%20Classify%20two,by%20their%20sides%20and%2For%20angles)). <br> - **Notes:** The six-lines triangle puzzle challenges 4th graders to apply their knowledge of **geometry and classification**. They must identify all the distinct triangles formed by the intersection of lines – a task linking to recognizing geometric figures within a complex drawing. This aligns with 4.GM.A.1/.2 by requiring students to recognize line intersections and triangular shapes, and understand what makes each triangle unique (different sets of line segments) ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,perpendicular%20lines%20and%20parallel%20lines)) ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20%23%23%23%23%204.GM.A.2%20Classify%20two,by%20their%20sides%20and%2For%20angles)). It’s a **higher-order problem-solving** exercise using 4th grade geometry concepts (points, line segments, and triangles). <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** Simplify the puzzle while still providing a challenge. For example: *“Draw a triangle. From two of its vertices, draw lines to the opposite sides (inside the triangle) so that the lines intersect each other within the triangle. How many triangles can you find in this figure?”* In this version, fourth graders have two lines inside a triangle (creating several smaller triangles). They would enumerate all triangles formed (including small ones and the large outer triangle). This adaptation leverages 4th grade understanding of lines and triangles, requiring systematic counting and shape classification to ensure none are missed. |
| **Fraction of Candies:** *“Juan had 12 candies, he ate 1/4 of them. How many candies did he eat?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=a,many%20candies%20did%20he%20eat)) | - **Standard:** 3.NF.A.2 – Understand a fraction as a number that represents a portion of a whole when a whole is partitioned equally ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,a%20portion%20of%20the%20whole)). <br> - **Notes:** This problem addresses **fractions and division**. For a 3rd grader, interpreting “$\frac{1}{4}$ of 12” is an application of understanding fractions as equal parts of a whole set. It meets the standard by having students recognize that eating one-fourth of the candies means dividing the 12 candies into 4 equal groups and taking one group ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,a%20portion%20of%20the%20whole)). This builds number sense with fractions (connecting $\frac{1}{4}$ to a division by 4) in an accessible way using a small total. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Frame it as equal sharing to solidify the concept. For example: *“Juan has 12 candies and wants to share them equally among 4 friends (which is like splitting into fourths). How many candies is 1/4 of his candies?”* By thinking of sharing, third graders can divide 12 by 4 to get 3, understanding that 3 candies is one-fourth of 12. The context of sharing aligns with their understanding of fractions as equal parts of a set. | - **Standard:** 4.NF.B.8 – Solve problems involving multiplication of a fraction by a whole number ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,fraction%20by%20a%20whole%20number)). <br> - **Notes:** In 4th grade, finding 1/4 of 12 is viewed as a **fraction multiplication** problem: $12 \times \frac{1}{4}=3$. The problem directly aligns with this standard, as students must multiply a whole number by a fraction to get the result ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,fraction%20by%20a%20whole%20number)). It reinforces fraction operations and understanding that fractions of a set can be found via multiplication or division. Fourth graders should also be able to explain *why* the answer is 3 (e.g. by reasoning that 1/4 means one out of four equal parts). <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** We can increase the complexity by using a non-unit fraction. For example: *“Juan had 12 candies, and he ate 3/4 of them. How many candies did he eat?”* Now students must calculate $3 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 12$ or recognize that 3/4 of 12 is three groups of 3 (which is 9). This aligns with 4th grade skills by combining understanding of unit fractions with scaling by the numerator, a direct application of fraction-by-whole-number multiplication. |
| **Equal Sharing Division:** *“There are 12 children around the table for the birthday party, and there are 4 tables. How many will sit at each table, if the tables all have the same number of children?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=b,How)) | - **Standard:** 3.RA.A.4 – Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve problems (equal groups, arrays, etc.) ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,within%20100%20to%20solve%20problems)). <br> - **Notes:** This is a straightforward **division (number sense)** problem. It aligns perfectly with 3rd grade expectations: students divide 12 by 4 to find 3, representing equal group distribution ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,within%20100%20to%20solve%20problems)). It reinforces understanding of division as making equal groups or sharing equally – a key concept in 3rd grade number operations. Solving it shows mastery of basic facts and interpreting word problems in context. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** The original is already a good 3rd grade-level problem. As another example, we could use slightly different numbers within their fact knowledge: *“There are 15 children and 3 tables, with the same number of children at each table. How many children sit at each table?”* This still requires a basic division fact (15 ÷ 3 = 5) and reinforces equal grouping in a familiar scenario. | - **Standard:** 4.NBT.A.7 – Find whole-number quotients and remainders with up to four-digit dividends and one-digit divisors ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=match%20at%20L261%20%2A%20,divisors%2C%20and%20justify%20the%20solution)). <br> - **Notes:** By 4th grade, students tackle larger division problems, but the **concept of equal grouping** remains foundational. A simple division like 12÷4 is assumed knowledge, but it underpins the ability to handle 4.NBT.A.7. In context, this problem can be seen as a stepping stone to multi-digit division: understanding how to partition a total into equal groups. It meets the spirit of the 4th grade standard by ensuring students are comfortable with division facts, which is crucial when dividing bigger numbers ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=match%20at%20L261%20%2A%20,divisors%2C%20and%20justify%20the%20solution)). <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** Use a larger dividend to increase the challenge while keeping the context. For example: *“There are 144 children attending a party, and they will be evenly seated at 4 tables. How many children will sit at each table?”* Now 4th graders must compute 144 ÷ 4 = 36, likely using place value strategies or the standard algorithm. This aligns with 4.NBT.A.7 by involving a three-digit dividend and shows the extension of equal-sharing concepts to larger numbers, a key 4th grade skill. |
| **Multiplicative Comparison:** *“Sam just got some money from her grandmother and now has 4 times as much as she had before. If she now has 12 dollars, how many dollars did she have before?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=c,as%20much%20as%20she%20had)) | - **Standard:** 3.RA.A.4 – Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve problems ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,within%20100%20to%20solve%20problems)). <br> - **Notes:** In 3rd grade, multiplication problems are often phrased as equal groups or arrays, and the phrase “4 times as much” is an early exposure to multiplicative comparison. Here, students can solve by recognizing it as the inverse of multiplication (what number times 4 equals 12?) which aligns with using basic facts (since $4 \times 3 = 12$) ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,within%20100%20to%20solve%20problems)). It meets the standard by providing a one-step multiplication/division word problem in context. This problem also builds a foundation for understanding comparative language (though fully developing that language is a 4th grade focus). <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Use the same numbers but perhaps simpler phrasing if needed: *“Sam had some money. After her grandma gave her more, she has 12 dollars now, which is 4 times what she had before. How many dollars did Sam have to start?”* This wording cues third graders to use multiplication/division to find the answer (12 ÷ 4), practicing fact fluency in a word problem. | - **Standard:** 4.RA.A.1 – Multiply or divide to solve problems involving multiplicative comparison ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,problems%20involving%20a%20multiplicative%20comparison)). <br> - **Notes:** This problem exemplifies a 4th grade **multiplicative comparison**: “now has 12, which is 4 times as much as before.” It directly aligns with 4.RA.A.1, which requires students to interpret and solve “times as many” situations ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,problems%20involving%20a%20multiplicative%20comparison)). Fourth graders will set up the relationship (if $x$ is the original amount, then $4x = 12$) and solve for $x$, demonstrating an understanding of how multiplication relates two quantities. This strengthens their algebraic reasoning and understanding of scaling. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** We can use a different factor or larger numbers for practice. For example: *“Sam now has 20 dollars, which is 5 times as much money as she had before. How much did she have before?”* This maintains the multiplicative comparison structure (now = 5 × before) and requires a division solution (20 ÷ 5 = 4). It aligns with the standard by using the comparison language explicitly and expecting students to solve it by reasoning about multiplication/division. |
| **Fraction of Marbles Lost:** *“Roberto had 12 marbles before playing with Ron. He now has 3 marbles. What fraction of his marbles did he lose?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=d,What%20fraction)) | - **Standard:** 3.NF.A.5 – Recognize and generate simple equivalent fractions using visual models, and understand why they are equivalent ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20%2A%20,why%20the%20fractions%20are%20equivalent)). <br> - **Notes:** Roberto’s situation involves finding the **fraction of the whole** that was lost. He lost 9 out of 12 marbles. Third graders can state this as “9/12 of his marbles.” Simplifying 9/12 to 3/4 is encouraged by the standard of recognizing equivalent fractions ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=match%20at%20L293%20%2A%20,why%20the%20fractions%20are%20equivalent)), though at this level they might need visual aids (like 12 marbles drawn, 9 crossed out). The problem meets 3rd grade standards by connecting a real context to fractions of a set and giving an opportunity to simplify a fraction (since 9/12 is equivalent to 3/4). It reinforces the concept of a fraction as part of a whole set of objects. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Emphasize the fraction idea in a relatable way. For example: *“Roberto had 12 marbles. He lost 9 of them. What fraction of his marbles is 9 out of 12?”* A third grader might first answer “9/12” and could be guided to simplify it to “3/4” using visual fraction models or reasoning (dividing numerator and denominator by 3). The focus is on expressing the lost marbles as a fraction of the starting amount, aligning with understanding fractions of a whole. | - **Standard:** 4.NF.A.2 – Recognize and generate equivalent fractions ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,Recognize%20and%20generate%20equivalent%20fractions)) (and also building on 4.NF.B.7 – multiplying fractions by whole numbers ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,fraction%20by%20a%20whole%20number)) for interpretation). <br> - **Notes:** Fourth graders should comfortably simplify 9/12 to 3/4 by finding common factors, which aligns with 4.NF.A.2 (equivalent fractions) ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,Recognize%20and%20generate%20equivalent%20fractions)). Understanding that Roberto lost **three-fourths** of his marbles ties into fraction equivalence and also fraction-of-a-quantity concepts. They might solve by computing the fraction: $9/12 = 3/4$, or by reasoning “he lost 3 out of every 4 marbles.” This problem meets 4th grade standards by requiring students to express a ratio of two whole numbers as a simplified fraction and to understand that fraction in context. <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** Use different numbers that still yield a reducible fraction. For example: *“Roberto had 10 marbles and now has 4. What fraction of his marbles did he lose?”* He lost 6 out of 10, which simplifies to 3/5. A 4th grader would determine 6/10 and then simplify it to 3/5 by dividing numerator and denominator by 2. This exercises their ability to find equivalent fractions and interpret the result (he lost **three-fifths** of his marbles) in line with the 4th grade fraction standards ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,Recognize%20and%20generate%20equivalent%20fractions)). |
| **Multi-Step Marble Games:** *“Michelle played two games of marbles. In the second game she doubled her marbles... she finds that she now has 6 times as many marbles as when she started. What happened in the first game?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=f,She)) | - **Standard:** 3.RA.D.9 – Solve two-step problems using the four operations, using a symbol for the unknown ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,operations%20to%20solve%20word%20problems)). <br> - **Notes:** This problem involves **multi-step reasoning** with multiplication. Third graders are just beginning to handle two-step problems; here they must infer what happened in the first game given the overall outcome. While “6 times as many after two games” might be challenging, it can be broken into steps: if doubling in the second game resulted in 6× total, the first game must have tripled her marbles (since 2 * 3 = 6). This fits the 3rd grade two-step problem framework because it requires an intermediate reasoning step (finding the factor from the first game) before answering ([IXL - Missouri third-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-3#:~:text=%2A%20,operations%20to%20solve%20word%20problems)). It encourages them to apply multiplication facts in a chained way (an early introduction to the idea of factors). <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 3):** Simplify the multiplicative relationship. For example: *“In the second game, Michelle doubled her marbles. After both games, she has 4 times as many marbles as when she started. What happened in the first game?”* Here the total factor is 4 instead of 6, so students can deduce the first game also doubled her marbles (since 2 * 2 = 4). This keeps the two-step structure (first game factor × second game factor = overall factor) but uses an easier relationship that 3rd graders can grasp with basic facts. They solve stepwise: realize that to get 4× in the end with a ×2 in the second game, the first game must have been ×2 as well. | - **Standard:** 4.RA.A.2 – Solve multi-step problems with whole numbers and variables ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,the%20reasonableness%20of%20the%20answer)). <br> - **Notes:** This scenario is well-suited for 4th grade as a rich **algebraic thinking** problem. Students must interpret “now 6 times as many as when she started” as a multiplicative relationship and combine it with the known doubling in the second game. The algebraic reasoning: let *x* be the start amount, after first game it’s *k·x*, after second game 2·(*k·x*) = 6x, so *k* = 3. Solving this requires a multi-step approach and possibly an equation, aligning with 4.RA.A.2 ([IXL - Missouri fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/missouri/math/grade-4#:~:text=,the%20reasonableness%20of%20the%20answer)). It highlights understanding of multiplication and factors in a problem-solving context, touching on an introductory concept of equations (2 * first_game_factor = 6). <br> - **Reformulated (Grade 4):** The original question is appropriate for 4th graders. We can present it in clearer terms: *“Michelle ended up with 6 times as many marbles as she started with. She knows in the second game she doubled her marbles. By what factor did her marbles multiply in the first game?”* Fourth graders would reason that the first game must have tripled her marbles (since $2 \times 3 = 6$). For an additional challenge, one could ask: *“If she started with 5 marbles, how many would she have after the first game? After the second game?”* to ensure they apply the factors sequentially. This maintains the multi-step structure and checks their ability to execute the inferred multiplication, solidifying their grasp of the combined effect of two multiplicative changes. |
