I will align the problems from your provided problem sets to the relevant 1st, 2nd, and 3rd grade Illinois educational standards. The output will be in a table format with separate columns for each grade level, ensuring alignment with the most representative standards while maintaining fidelity to the original problems. I'll comprehensively cover key topics relevant to the problems across number sense, measurement, and problem-solving. I'll let you know when the research is ready for your review.

| **Problem Scenario** | **1st Grade (IL Standard Alignment)** | **2nd Grade (IL Standard Alignment)** | **3rd Grade (IL Standard Alignment)** |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Candy Count (Take-Away)** <br><br> *Original Problem:* John had 8 candies. He eats 3 of them. How many candies does he have now? | **Standard (IL 1.OA.1):** Use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve **“taking from”** word problems with unknown results ([1st Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/illinois-standards#:~:text=,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). <br> **Notes:** This simple subtraction scenario (8 – 3 = 5) is within 1st grade limits. It involves a concrete take-away context (removing 3 candies from 8) and can be modeled with objects or drawings, satisfying 1.OA.1’s requirement of using addition/subtraction in real-world situations. <br> **Reformulated for 1st Grade:** *John has 8 candies. He gives 3 candies to his friend. How many candies does John have left?* (Students may use counters or a number line to remove 3 from 8, finding 5.) | **Standard (IL 2.OA.1):** Use addition and subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems (including **“adding to” and “taking from”** situations) ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). <br> **Notes:** This two-step version stays within 100 and requires sequential operations, aligning with 2.OA.1’s extension to two-step problems. Students must first add, then subtract, keeping track of both steps. <br> **Reformulated for 2nd Grade:** *John had 50 candies. He **received 20 more** candies for his birthday, then **ate 15** of them. How many candies does he have now?* (Students solve 50 + 20 = 70, then 70 – 15 = 55, using drawings or equations with a symbol for the unknown, per 2.OA.1.) | **Standard (IL 3.OA.8):** Solve two-step word problems using the four operations, representing them with equations and using reasoning to check answers ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=%23%23%20CC.3.OA.8.%20Solve%20two,and%20estimation%20strategies%20including%20rounding)). <br> **Notes:** This multi-step problem involves **multiplication** (equal groups of candies) followed by **subtraction**, fitting 3.OA.8’s criteria of two operations. It also reinforces 3rd grade multiplication/division contexts (3.OA.3) within 100 ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)) while requiring an equation with an unknown. <br> **Reformulated for 3rd Grade:** *John had 3 bags of candies with 8 candies in each bag. He then **eats 5** candies. How many candies does he have left?* (Students represent this as 3 × 8 – 5 = □, find 24 – 5 = 19, and can check that the result makes sense, addressing 3.OA.8.) |
| **Comparing Quantities (More/Less)** <br><br> *Original Problem:* Susan has $3 in her pocket. Claire has $8. How much less does Susan have? | **Standard (IL 1.OA.1):** Solve addition/subtraction word problems within 20, including **comparison scenarios** with unknown differences ([1st Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/illinois-standards#:~:text=,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). <br> **Notes:** This problem exemplifies a “compare – how many less” situation (Claire 8 vs Susan 3). First graders solve it by finding the difference 5, which is within 1.OA.1’s scope of comparative word problems. They might use drawings (e.g. two sets of dots) or count up from 3 to 8 to find the difference. <br> **Reformulated for 1st Grade:** *Susan has 3 dollars. Claire has 8 dollars. **How many more dollars does Claire have than Susan?*** (Same numbers, rephrased in “how many more” form. Students can conclude 5 more, since 3 + 5 = 8.) | **Standard (IL 2.OA.1):** Solve one- and two-step word problems within 100, including **comparison** with unknowns in any position ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). <br> **Notes:** With larger numbers, this remains a one-step comparison. It reinforces 2nd graders’ ability to subtract within 100 and understand comparative language. The numbers chosen (80 and 30) keep the arithmetic simple (difference 50) while requiring place-value reasoning if done via subtraction. <br> **Reformulated for 2nd Grade:** *Susan has 30 dollars. Claire has 80 dollars. **How much less** does Susan have than Claire?* (Students recognize this asks for the difference 80 – 30 = 50, using base-10 strategies or equations to find the answer, consistent with 2.OA.1.) | **Standard (IL 3.OA.8):** Solve two-step problems using addition, subtraction, etc., and assess answer reasonableness ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=%23%23%20CC.3.OA.8.%20Solve%20two,and%20estimation%20strategies%20including%20rounding)). <br> **Notes:** This extended comparison problem (adapted from PS2) involves **multiple steps**: finding Brother A’s height difference, accounting for the “4 inches more” condition, and then finding Sister B’s height. It requires 3rd graders to perform and relate two subtraction calculations, a clear two-step scenario. The complexity of the language also encourages using an equation with a letter (e.g., let Sister B’s height = h) to organize information, as per 3.OA.8. <br> **Reformulated for 3rd Grade:** *Brother A is 60 inches tall and Sister A is 50 inches tall. Brother B is 55 inches tall. Brother A stands **4 inches taller** above his sister **than** Brother B stands above his sister. How tall is Sister B?* (Students determine Brother A’s sibling height difference is 10 inches, so Brother B’s difference must be 6 inches since it is 4 inches less. They then compute Sister B’s height as 55 – 6 = 49 inches. This multi-step reasoning aligns with 3.OA.8’s expectations.Original context fidelity is preserved, but numbers are scaled to 3rd-grade level.) |
| **Unknown Start (Add-To scenario)** <br><br> *Original Problem:* Juanita has just been given $3 by her grandmother. She now has $8. How many dollars did she have before? | **Standard (IL 1.OA.4):** Understand subtraction as an **unknown-addend** problem (find the missing part that adds to a given total) ([1st Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-1/illinois-standards#:~:text=,10%20when%20added%20to%208)). <br> **Notes:** This problem presents an “add to, start unknown” structure: initial amount + 3 = 8. First graders solve it by recognizing that the number which makes 8 when 3 is added is 5 (either by subtraction 8–3, or counting up from 3 to 8). This directly demonstrates 1.OA.4, treating the subtraction as finding an unknown addend. <br> **Reformulated for 1st Grade:** *Juanita now has 8 dollars after her grandmother gave her 3 dollars. **How many dollars did Juanita have to start with?*** (Students can use counters or think “3 + ___ = 8” to find the answer 5.) | **Standard (IL 2.OA.1):** One- and two-step word problems within 100, including those with the **start unknown** ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). <br> **Notes:** Using larger values extends the first-grade problem to second-grade difficulty while preserving structure. Students must subtract 30 from 80 to find the initial amount, exercising their fluency within 100 and understanding of the relationship between addition and subtraction. It’s a single-step here (unknown addend), fitting 2.OA.1. <br> **Reformulated for 2nd Grade:** *Juanita has 80 dollars now, after her grandmother gave her 30 dollars for her birthday. **How much money did Juanita have before** she got the gift?* (Students set up 30 + □ = 80 and solve by computing 80 – 30 = 50. This engages 2.NBT skills for subtraction within 100 as well.) | **Standard (IL 3.NBT.2):** Fluently add and subtract within 1000 using strategies and algorithms based on place value ([CA Content Standards (CA Dept of Education)](https://www2.cde.ca.gov/cacs/id/web/342#:~:text=Standard%3A%20Fluently%20add%20and%20subtract,relationship%20between%20addition%20and%20subtraction)). <br> **Notes:** This version increases the numbers into the hundreds, appropriate for 3rd grade arithmetic. While the structure is still a one-step unknown-addend problem, it tests fluency with larger numbers and an understanding of place value in subtraction. Students might use a column subtraction or mental strategy to find the difference. The scenario also ties into 3.OA.8’s emphasis on checking reasonableness: students can estimate that since 30 is a small part of 140, the answer around 110 makes sense. <br> **Reformulated for 3rd Grade:** *Juanita has 140 dollars now. Her grandmother gave her 30 dollars as a gift. **How much did Juanita have before** she got the gift?* (Students solve 140 – 30 = 110. This showcases 3.NBT.2 fluency with a three-digit subtraction, and they can double-check by adding 110 + 30 to ensure it sums back to 140.) ([CA Content Standards (CA Dept of Education)](https://www2.cde.ca.gov/cacs/id/web/342#:~:text=Standard%3A%20Fluently%20add%20and%20subtract,relationship%20between%20addition%20and%20subtraction)) |

I will expand the alignment to Illinois standards by including more challenging problems. The updated table will include a balance of number sense, algebraic thinking, fractions, and geometry, along with a mix of multi-step problems and conceptual reasoning tasks like function rules and meta-step problems. I'll let you know when the research is ready for your review.

<td>*John had 8 candies, he eats 3 of them. How many candies does he have now?*</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.1.OA.1 (Use addition/subtraction within 20 to solve word problems)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Simple “take from” scenario using small numbers (8 and 3) aligns with 1.OA.1, as first graders solve subtraction story problems with objects or drawings. The context and numbers are within 10, appropriate for 1st grade fluency.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *John had 8 candies and ate 3. How many candies does John have left?* (First graders can draw 8 circles, cross out 3, and count the remainder to solve.)
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.2.OA.1 (Solve one- and two-step addition/subtraction word problems within 100)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Uses larger numbers (within 100) to increase complexity while keeping a one-step structure. This meets 2nd grade expectations to subtract within 100 using strategies (e.g. 45 – 18). It reinforces place value understanding and subtraction with regrouping in context ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,within%2020)).<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *John had 45 candies. He ate 18 of them. How many candies does he have now?* (Second graders may use drawings or base-ten blocks to subtract 18 from 45, aligning with 2.NBT.5 fluency in subtracting two-digit numbers.)

<strong>Note:</strong> Increases the numbers into the hundreds to align with 3rd grade fluency expectations. Students must subtract within 1000, practicing regrouping and ensuring understanding of place value ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=,relationship%20between%20addition%20and%20subtraction)). The one-step subtraction remains straightforward, focusing on the larger-scale calculation and number sense.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *John had 123 candies. He gave away 45 of them. How many candies does he have left?* (Third graders can write the equation 123 – 45 and solve using place value strategies or the standard algorithm, meeting 3.NBT.2.)

<tr>
<td>*Juanita has just been given $3 by her grandmother. She now has $8. How many dollars did she have before?*</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.1.OA.4 (Understand subtraction as an unknown-addend problem)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> This problem presents an “unknown-start” addition scenario (___ + 3 = 8), which 1st graders solve by finding the missing addend. It builds algebraic thinking by relating addition and subtraction: students realize that finding how many she had before is equivalent to 8 – 3.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Juanita’s grandma gave her 3 dollars. Now Juanita has 8 dollars in total. How many dollars did Juanita have to begin with?* (Students might use counters or think “3 plus what makes 8?” to find the answer, reinforcing the relationship 8 = 3 + ___.)
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.2.OA.1 (One- and two-step word problems with unknowns in all positions)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Extends the unknown-addend concept to larger numbers. Still a one-step problem, it fits 2nd grade because the total and added amount are within 100. Students use more advanced strategies or equations to find the unknown starting amount (e.g., 68 – 25), reinforcing the inverse relation of addition and subtraction from 1st grade.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Juanita’s grandmother gave her $25. Now Juanita has $68 in total. How many dollars did Juanita have before getting Grandma’s gift?* (Second graders can write 25 + ___ = 68 or 68 – 25 = ___, and solve, possibly by subtracting or counting up. This addresses a compare problem with the “unknown-start” format.)
</td>

<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.3.OA.8 (Solve two-step problems and assess reasonableness); CC.3.NBT.2 (Add/subtract within 1000) ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=,relationship%20between%20addition%20and%20subtraction))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Uses a larger round-number total (500) and a three-digit known addend. While still essentially one subtraction, it reinforces understanding of addition/subtraction within 1000 ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=,relationship%20between%20addition%20and%20subtraction)). It also prepares students for multi-step reasoning by having them interpret the situation and check that the answer (the amount before) makes sense (it should be less than the total).<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Juanita’s grandma gave her $123. Now Juanita has $500 in total. How many dollars did Juanita have before the gift?* (Third graders set up 123 + ___ = 500, solve by computing 500 – 123, and double-check by adding their answer to 123 to ensure it sums to 500. This reinforces the inverse relationship and estimation skills.)

<td>*Roberto had 12 marbles before playing with Ron. He now has 3 marbles. What fraction of his marbles did he lose?*</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.1.OA.6 (Add and subtract within 20 fluently); supporting CC.1.G.3 (Halves, fourths in circles and rectangles) ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,fourth%20of%2C%20and%20quarter%20of))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> First graders aren’t required to compute fractions of a set, so the problem is simplified to focus on the subtraction within 20. They solve how many marbles Roberto lost (12 – 3 = 9) using counting or drawings. The idea of “fraction of his marbles” is beyond grade 1, but teachers might informally connect that losing 9 out of 12 is losing “most of” his marbles (more than half) to build intuitive fraction sense.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Roberto had 12 marbles and lost some while playing. Now he has 3 marbles left. How many marbles did Roberto lose?* (Students do 12 – 3 = 9. As an extension discussion, note that 9 is more than half of 12, introducing the concept of “more than a half” in informal terms.)
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.2.G.3 (Partition circles/rectangles into two, three, or four equal shares; describe the whole as halves, thirds, fourths) ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,not%20have%20the%20same%20shape))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> In 2nd grade, students learn basic fractions as equal parts of shapes, not usually sets of objects. This problem bridges that gap by interpreting 12 marbles as a whole partitioned into equal groups. Roberto’s 9 lost marbles out of 12 can be seen as 3 groups of 3 out of 4 equal groups of 3, i.e., **¾** of his marbles. Although 2nd graders don’t formally write “3/4” for sets, they can recognize that 9 is “three out of four equal parts” of 12. Here they discover that losing 9 of 12 is losing “three-fourths” of the marbles ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,not%20have%20the%20same%20shape)).<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Roberto had 12 marbles and lost 9 of them. What fraction of his marbles did he lose?* (Hint: First find how many marbles make half of 12. Is 9 more than half? How many equal groups of 3 are in 12? Students see 12 split into four groups of 3, and 9 corresponds to 3 of those groups, so he lost 3 out of 4 equal parts of his marbles.)
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.3.NF.1 (Understand a fraction 1/b as one part of a whole partitioned into b parts; a/b as a parts of size 1/b) ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=,a%20parts%20of%20size%201%2Fb))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> By 3rd grade, students formally understand fractions as parts of a set or whole. This problem directly asks for the fraction of the set of marbles that were lost. Students determine that 9 out of 12 is **9/12**, and they recognize or simplify this fraction to **3/4** ([3rd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-3/illinois-standards#:~:text=,a%20parts%20of%20size%201%2Fb)). They explain that if 12 marbles is the whole (4 equal groups of 3), the 9 lost marbles represent 3 of those 4 equal groups, i.e. three-fourths of the whole set.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Roberto had 12 marbles and now has 3 left. What fraction of his marbles did he lose?* (Third graders compute that he lost 9 out of 12 marbles, express it as 9/12, and simplify to 3/4, explaining that he lost three-fourths of his marbles.)

<td>*A square is turned on its corner so it looks like a diamond. Is it still a square? Why or why not?* <br><em>(Class discussion on shape attributes)</em></td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.1.G.1 (Distinguish defining attributes vs. non-defining, e.g. orientation) ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,wide%20variety%20of%20shapes%3B%20build))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Emphasizes that a shape’s defining attributes (four equal sides, four corners) remain the same even when its orientation changes ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,wide%20variety%20of%20shapes%3B%20build)). First graders learn that a “diamond” is just a square rotated – the name or rotation doesn’t change the shape. This problem builds understanding that color or orientation are non-defining attributes of shapes.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Your teacher draws a square on the board, then rotates it 45°. “What shape is it now?”* Students realize it is still a square (even if some might call it a “diamond”), because it still has 4 equal sides and 4 corners. This reinforces 1.G.1 by focusing on the essential attributes of a square.
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.2.G.1 (Recognize and draw shapes having specified attributes, e.g. given number of angles or equal faces) ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,quadrilaterals%2C%20pentagons%2C%20hexagons%2C%20and%20cubes))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Second graders classify shapes by properties like number of sides or angles, rather than by orientation ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,quadrilaterals%2C%20pentagons%2C%20hexagons%2C%20and%20cubes)). In this task, they confirm that the rotated figure has 4 sides and 4 angles, satisfying the properties of a square. It reinforces that orientation does not alter a shape’s identity. Students might also identify the shape as a special kind of quadrilateral (a rhombus, commonly called a diamond).<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Draw a square and turn your paper so the square looks like a diamond. How many sides and corners does it have now?* After counting, students conclude it still has 4 sides and 4 corners, matching the definition of a square. This shows that even turned, it’s the same shape – a square (and also a rhombus, since it has four equal sides).
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.3.G.1 (Understand that shapes in different categories can share attributes, defining larger categories) ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,attributes%20can%20define%20a%20larger))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Third graders delve deeper into shape categories. They recognize that a “diamond” shape is a common term for a rhombus, and a square is a special type of rhombus (and also a rectangle) because it shares attributes (four equal sides, four right angles) ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,attributes%20can%20define%20a%20larger)). Thus, a rotated square belongs to both the square category and the larger rhombus category. This problem gets students to articulate why the rotated shape is still a square and how shapes can have multiple names depending on attributes.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Is a square rotated 45° (often called a diamond) still a square? Explain.* Third graders might say: “Yes – it’s still a square because it has the same attributes. A rotated square is also a rhombus, since it has four equal sides. Orientation doesn’t change what shape it is.” This aligns with 3.G.1 by highlighting shared attributes and classification.

<td>*Luke had 5 toy cars. He got 3 more for his birthday, then gave 2 cars to his brother. How many toy cars does Luke have now?* <br><em>(Multi-step problem)</em></td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.1.OA.1 (Solve addition and subtraction word problems within 20)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Although first grade standards focus on single-step problems, this two-step problem remains within 10 and can be approached with teacher guidance. It builds perseverance and understanding of sequential operations. Students first add (5 + 3 = 8) and then subtract (8 – 2 = 6) using objects or drawings, which introduces the idea of multi-step problem solving even though it’s not explicit in 1st grade standards.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Luke had 5 toy cars. He got 3 new cars as gifts. Now how many cars does he have? Then Luke gave 2 of his cars to his brother. How many cars does Luke have left?* (Breaking it into two questions guides first graders through the steps: first find 5 + 3, then take away 2. This scaffolding aligns with 1.OA.1 by using basic addition and subtraction sequentially.)
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.2.OA.1 (Use addition/subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step word problems)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Two-step problems are explicitly expected in 2nd grade. This problem, still with small numbers, allows focus on the structure of multi-step reasoning. Students must decide to add first, then subtract, reflecting understanding of the language and sequence of events. Solving 5 + 3 = 8 and then 8 – 2 = 6 demonstrates their ability to perform two operations in context, fulfilling 2.OA.1’s multi-step requirement.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Luke had 5 toy cars, got 3 more, and then gave 2 away. How many does he have in the end?* (Students solve in two steps or use a combined equation like 5 + 3 – 2 = __. They might draw a picture or write two number sentences to arrive at 6 cars. This reinforces understanding of addition and subtraction in tandem.)
</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.3.OA.8 (Solve two-step word problems using the four operations)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> For 3rd grade, this problem is a quick exercise in multi-step thinking since the numbers are easy. Third graders can focus on explaining **why** they add then subtract, and check the answer’s reasonableness (after gaining and then giving away, the result should be a bit more than the start). They might also represent it with a single expression (5 + 3 – 2) and solve using order of operations understanding. This addresses 3.OA.8 by requiring multiple steps and reasoning about the operations.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Luke had 5 toy cars, got 3 more, then gave 2 to his brother. How many toy cars does Luke have now?* (Third graders will likely do this mentally to get 6, then explain their process and double-check by reasoning: “He ended with 2 more than he started, since +3 and –2 net to +1.” This fosters estimation and reflection per 3.OA.8.)

<td>*“Add 3 to a number” pattern rule – find a scenario or sequence that fits this rule.*</td>
<td>
<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.1.OA.5 (Relate counting to addition – count on to add)<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> While first graders don’t formally study numeric patterns beyond simple counts, this task introduces a constant increase scenario. It connects to 1.OA.5 by using the “counting on” strategy repeatedly. Students observe that each step adds 3, reinforcing the idea of addition as consistent increment. This gentle exposure to patterns builds a foundation for later algebraic thinking.<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Ella is stacking blocks in a pattern. On Monday she stacked 2 blocks. On Tuesday she stacked 5 blocks. On Wednesday she stacked 8 blocks. If this pattern continues, how many blocks will Ella stack on Thursday?* (First graders notice that the number of blocks increases by 3 each day: 2, 5, 8… so Thursday will have 11 blocks. They are practicing “+3” repeatedly, an early exploration of patterns.)

<strong>Note:</strong> Second graders are fluent in skip-counting by 2s, 5s, 10s, etc., and can apply similar thinking to a skip-count-by-3 pattern as an enrichment. Recognizing an “add 3” pattern strengthens understanding of equal intervals and repeated addition, preparing for multiplication concepts ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,write%20an%20equation%20to%20express)). They might use mental addition or cumulative sums to extend the sequence. This goes slightly beyond the standard skip-count sequences, providing a challenging exercise in pattern recognition and addition fluency ([2nd Grade Math. Illinois Learning Standards Illinois Learning Standards](https://newpathworksheets.com/math/grade-2/illinois-standards#:~:text=,within%2020)).<br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Ella is practicing piano. On day 1 she plays 2 songs. On day 2 she plays 5 songs. On day 3 she plays 8 songs. If this pattern continues (adding 3 songs each day), how many songs will she play on day 4?* (Second graders add 3 each time: 2, 5, 8, then 11 songs on day 4. They should also describe the rule in words – “she adds three more songs each day” – reinforcing understanding of the pattern.)

<strong>Standard:</strong> CC.3.OA.9 (Identify arithmetic patterns and explain them using properties of operations) ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,explain%20them%20using%20properties%20of))<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Third graders are expected to recognize patterns like this and articulate the rule behind them ([The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating the Common Core](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=CC,explain%20them%20using%20properties%20of)). For an “add 3” pattern, they identify the constant difference of 3 and explain it using addition properties (e.g. commutativity doesn’t change the sum; each term = previous term + 3). They can also relate the sequence to a formula (start at 2 and add 3 each time). This aligns with 3.OA.9 by having students find and justify the rule of an arithmetic sequence. <br>
<strong>Reformulated Problem:</strong> *Ella is skip-counting in a new way: 2, 5, 8, 11, … Each day her count increases by the same amount. What is the rule for her pattern, and what number will she count on Day 5?* (Third graders identify the rule “add 3” and apply it to find the 5th term (14). They explain that the pattern increases by 3 each time – an arithmetic pattern – and may check by differences or express the nth term as 2 + 3*(n–1).)
