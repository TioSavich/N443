| **Original Problem** | **2nd Grade Alignment (Standards, Notes, Adaptation)** | **3rd Grade Alignment (Standards, Notes, Adaptation)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Triangle of Pennies Puzzle:** *“Thirty-six pennies are arranged to form a triangle (the first 15 are shown). What is the fewest number of moves to turn the triangle upside down if only one penny may be moved at a time?”* | **Standard(s):** This open-ended puzzle isn’t tied to a specific Grade 2 content standard, but it strongly develops **Mathematical Practice MP1** – *“Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them”* ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9#:~:text=1%20Make%20sense%20of%20problems,explaining%20to%20themselves%20the%20meaning)). Second graders learn to try simple cases and use logic, aligning with the problem-solving emphasis of MP1.<br>**Notes:** Solving this requires reasoning about shapes and positions rather than calculation, which helps young students build persistence and spatial reasoning. It supports the grade 2 goal of developing problem-solving strategies, even though the content (rearranging coins to form shapes) is an enrichment activity beyond routine curriculum.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Use 6 pennies to make a triangle shape (with 3 pennies in the base row, 2 in the next, 1 at the top). Move just **one** penny to make the triangle point upside down.”* (This simpler version uses fewer coins so second graders can experiment and discover the solution, building perseverance.) | **Standard(s):** Similar to grade 2, this puzzle builds **Mathematical Practice MP7** – *“Look for and make use of structure”* ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9#:~:text=7%20Look%20for%20and%20make,seven%20more%20is%20the%20same)). While not directly a content standard, it aligns with grade 3 expectations that students recognize patterns or structures in problems. Here they must discern the triangular arrangement’s structure to solve the puzzle.<br>**Notes:** A third grader uses structure and systematic thinking to minimize moves, which connects to the grade 3 focus on reasoning and problem solving. Although not a typical arithmetic problem, it enriches their geometric thinking and strategic planning skills, reflecting the problem-solving competencies expected by Michigan standards (MP7, MP1).<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Use 10 pennies to form a triangle with 4 pennies in the bottom row, then 3, 2, 1 in each above row. What is the **fewest number of pennies** you need to move one at a time to make the triangle point downward?”* (With slightly more coins, third graders apply structural reasoning to find an optimal solution, persevering through a more complex puzzle.) |
| **Growing Dot Pattern:** *“Marcy wants to know the number of dots in the 20th step of a pattern without drawing all 20 figures.”* (An image of the first few pattern steps was provided.) | **Standard(s):** Michigan expects second graders to recognize and extend simple numerical patterns as a precursor to algebraic thinking. While no explicit pattern standard exists in Grade 2, this task relates to **skip-counting and repeated addition** skills (e.g. counting by 2s, 5s, 10s) ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,to%20record%20the%20results%20of)), which are part of 2.NBT.2 and lay the foundation for pattern problems.<br>**Notes:** Determining the 20th term encourages students to apply addition repeatedly instead of brute-force drawing. This supports 2nd grade development in using structure – for example, if each step adds a fixed number of dots, students practice adding that number multiple times (akin to skip-counting). It aligns with 2nd graders’ learning to solve problems by identifying regularity in repetition, an emerging skill at this stage.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Marcy sees a sequence of dot figures growing in a pattern. She doesn’t want to draw all the figures up to the 10th step. **If the pattern adds the same number of dots each time**, how can she find the number of dots in Step 10 without drawing every figure?”* (This version uses the 10th step – a smaller step number – and emphasizes the idea of a constant growth rate, so second graders can apply repeated addition or skip-counting to find the answer.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.9** – *“Identify arithmetic patterns … and explain them using properties of operations”* ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9#:~:text=9,decomposed%20into%20two%20equal%20addends)). Third graders are expected to recognize patterns in numbers and use operations to describe or predict them. Determining the 20th term of a pattern fits this standard, as students must find the rule (e.g. “add 3 each time”) and apply it.<br>**Notes:** This problem engages third graders in algebraic thinking by having them generalize a pattern. They identify the rule and use multiplication or repeated addition to jump to the 20th step, which exemplifies explaining a pattern with operations (for instance, *if 4 dots are added each step, then Step 20 has 4×19 more dots than Step 1*). This is directly in line with 3.OA.9’s focus on arithmetic patterns and also reinforces fluency in addition/multiplication within 1000 as expected by 3.NBT.2 ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3,%28A%20range%20of)) if the numbers grow large.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“A dot pattern grows by the **same amount each step**. If the first step has some dots, and by Step 20 Marcy figures out there will be 85 dots, how could she have calculated that without drawing every step? Explain the pattern rule and how it gives the answer for Step 20.”* (This version encourages a third grader to articulate the pattern rule and use it to compute the 20th term, exercising their ability to recognize and justify arithmetic patterns.) |
| **Coin Flip Sequences:** *“How many different sequences of heads and tails are possible if you flip a coin 2 times? 3 times? ... 9 times?”* | **Standard(s):** This problem informally introduces **arrays and early multiplication concepts**. In Grade 2, students work with arrays and equal groups (2.OA.4: using addition to find totals in arrays) ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,the%20total%20number%20of%20them)), which relates to counting coin-flip outcomes. For example, 2 flips can be seen as a 2x2 array of outcomes. This connection to arrays and doubling prepares students for understanding multiplication.<br>**Notes:** Listing outcomes for a 2-flip scenario (HH, HT, TH, TT) encourages a second grader to organize information, a skill underpinning data interpretation standards. It also reinforces the idea of **doubling** (each additional coin doubles outcomes), which is a numerical pattern they can observe even if not formally required by Grade 2 standards. This exploration builds intuitive understanding of combinations in a simple context, aligning with the problem-solving and grouping skills expected by the end of 2nd grade.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“If you flip a coin **two times**, what are all the possible outcomes? (For example, one outcome is Heads then Tails.) How many different outcomes are there in total?”* (This simplified task has second graders list or count the 4 outcomes of 2 flips, using basic combinatorial reasoning in an age-appropriate way.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.9** – focusing on identifying patterns in arithmetic ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9#:~:text=9,decomposed%20into%20two%20equal%20addends)). The coin-flip problem yields a pattern (2, 4, 8, … outcomes), which third graders can recognize as *“each time, the number of possibilities doubles.”* Explaining this pattern connects to understanding multiplication by 2. It also touches on **3.OA.1** (interpreting products) since 2×2×2… structure is inherent, although not explicitly stated in the standards, the doubling pattern can be justified with multiplication properties (an aspect of 3.OA.9).<br>**Notes:** Third graders can generalize that flipping an additional coin multiplies the outcomes by 2. This reasoning shows they can discern a multiplicative pattern and articulate it, which is exactly the kind of arithmetic regularity 3.OA.9 expects. While probability/combinatorics isn’t a formal third-grade topic, the problem provides a real-world application of multiplication (e.g. 2 flips = 2×2 outcomes, 3 flips = 2×2×2 outcomes) reinforcing their understanding of factors and patterns in a set of outcomes.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“If you flip a coin **three times**, how many different sequences of heads-and-tails could you get? Can you describe a strategy to find the answer without listing every possibility?”* (This version has third graders find 8 outcomes for 3 flips and invites them to explain the doubling pattern or use multiplication, aligning with their multiplication skills and pattern recognition abilities.) |
| **Sibling Height Difference:** *“Two friends (Brother A and Brother B) each have a younger sister. They argue about who is ‘taller over’ his sister. For example, Brother A is 166 cm tall and Sister A is 67 cm tall; Brother B is 173 cm tall and Sister B’s height is unknown. If Brother A “won” by 17 cm (meaning Brother A’s height advantage over his sister is 17 cm more than Brother B’s advantage), how tall is Sister B?”* | **Standard(s):** **2.OA.1** – solving one- and two-step addition/subtraction word problems with unknowns in all positions ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). This scenario is essentially a two-step problem: each brother’s height difference must be found and then compared. Although comparing two differences is complex, it can be framed in simpler Grade 2 terms as two sequential subtraction steps within 100.<br>**Notes:** In grade 2, students solve compare problems (e.g. “how many more?”). This task extends that idea: first find each sibling height difference, then compare those differences. For a second grader, we simplify numbers and concept, but it still involves a compare situation with an unknown. It meets 2.OA.1 by involving *“taking from”* (subtraction to find each height gap) and then *“comparing”* those results. It reinforces understanding of subtraction as comparison, a skill developed in second grade.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Brother A is 120 cm tall and his sister is 100 cm tall. Brother B is 130 cm tall and his sister is 115 cm tall. **Which brother is taller compared to his own sister, and by how many centimeters?**”* (In this version, Brother A’s height difference is 20 cm and Brother B’s is 15 cm, so second graders determine that Brother A has a 5 cm greater height advantage. This keeps numbers friendly and focuses on a straightforward compare-differences subtraction.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.8** – *“Solve two-step word problems using the four operations… represent these problems with equations…”* ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3.%20OA.8%20Solve%20two,digit%20arithmetic)). The sibling problem is inherently two-step: subtract to find each height difference, then subtract those differences. Third graders are expected to handle such multi-step problems with unknowns.<br>**Notes:** This task requires students to integrate two subtraction steps, fitting well with 3.OA.8’s multi-step criteria. A third grader would likely set up an equation or logical reasoning: e.g., let Sister B’s height be *x* and form an equation like (Brother A – Sister A) = (Brother B – *x*) + 17. Solving it involves two operations. Although algebraic notation is optional, the ability to handle the logic of “a difference that is 17 more than another difference” demonstrates the advanced problem-solving intended in grade 3. It also showcases fluency in subtraction within 1000 as per 3.NBT.2 ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3,%28A%20range%20of)) when using the given heights.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Brother A is 150 cm tall and Sister A is 100 cm tall. Brother B is 160 cm tall. Brother A’s height-over-sister is **10 cm more** than Brother B’s height-over-his-sister. **How tall is Sister B?**”* (Third graders first find Brother A’s sibling-height difference = 50 cm, then understand Brother B’s difference must be 40 cm, and finally subtract 40 from Brother B’s 160 cm to get Sister B’s height (120 cm). This two-step problem aligns perfectly with the grade 3 standard for multi-step word problems.) |
| **Basic Word Problem (Take From – Result Unknown):** *“John had 8 candies. He eats 3 of them. How many candies does he have now?”* | **Standard(s):** **2.OA.1** – one-step “taking from” scenarios with unknown result ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). This directly exemplifies a Grade 2 level subtraction word problem within 20.<br>**Notes:** John’s problem is a straightforward example of *“taking from (result unknown)”*, one of the situation types listed in 2.OA.1. Solving 8–3 reinforces fluency within 20 and understanding that subtraction tells “how many are left,” a key Grade 2 concept. It meets the standard’s expectation that students use drawings or equations with a symbol (e.g. 8 – 3 = □) to represent and solve such problems.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“John had 15 candies. He ate 7 of them. **How many candies does he have left?**”* (Uses slightly larger numbers while still within second-grade limits. Students subtract 7 from 15 to find the result, just as in the original, practicing the same skill with different numbers.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.8** – solving two-step problems using the four operations ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3.%20OA.8%20Solve%20two,digit%20arithmetic)). Although John’s scenario is a single-step subtraction, a third-grade extension is to incorporate an additional step, creating a two-step problem that remains accessible to them.<br>**Notes:** Third graders have typically mastered one-step subtraction, so we deepen the complexity. By adding a second operation (such as an extra action after eating candies), we ensure the problem aligns with 3.OA.8’s multi-step criterion. The first step (subtraction) is familiar, and the second step (often addition in our version) requires them to incorporate another operation and possibly represent the situation with an equation chain. This not only meets 3.OA.8 but also reinforces 3.NBT.2 fluency with larger numbers.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“John had 40 candies. He gave 15 of them to his sister, and later his friend gave him 5 more candies. **How many candies does John have now?**”* (This grade 3 version requires two steps: 40 – 15 = 25, then 25 + 5 = 30, aligning with the expectation that third graders solve two-step word problems and possibly write an equation like 40 – 15 + 5 = □ to represent the situation.) |
| **Basic Word Problem (Take Apart – Part Unknown):** *“There are 8 children around the table for Dorothy’s birthday, and 3 of them are drinking juice. How many are not drinking juice?”* | **Standard(s):** **2.OA.1** – one-step “part-part-whole” problems (putting together/taking apart) with unknown addend ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). This scenario gives a total and one part, asking for the other part, which is a classic Grade 2 problem structure.<br>**Notes:** This fits the *“put together/take apart”* category: 8 total children = 3 with juice + □ without juice. It reinforces understanding of subtraction as finding an unknown part (□ = 8 – 3). Second graders at this stage use drawings or simple equations (3 + □ = 8) to solve such problems. It meets the standard by having an unknown in one of the parts and requiring addition/subtraction within 20.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“There are 12 children at the picnic, and 5 of them are drinking juice. **How many children are not drinking juice?**”* (Uses slightly larger numbers while maintaining the same part-whole structure: students compute 12 – 5 to find the missing part.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.8** – extending to a two-step scenario ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3.%20OA.8%20Solve%20two,digit%20arithmetic)). We increase complexity by adding another event, which requires a second operation beyond the initial part-whole subtraction.<br>**Notes:** In third grade, students can handle a scenario where, for instance, after finding how many are not drinking juice, more children join or leave. This requires them to take the result of the first step and then perform a second calculation, aligning with 3.OA.8. It also encourages them to possibly write sequential equations or use logical reasoning for the multi-step situation. The underlying subtraction within 100 is straightforward (supporting 3.NBT.2 fluency), but the challenge is in doing it in context and then updating the total – a key 3rd grade skill.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“There are 12 children at a party, and 5 of them are drinking juice. **How many are not drinking juice?** Then 3 more children (who are not drinking juice) join the party. **Now how many children are not drinking juice in total?**”* (Students first find 7 not drinking (12–5), then add the 3 new non-juice drinkers to get 10. This two-step problem requires them to adjust a previous result, demonstrating multi-step problem solving.) |
| **Basic Word Problem (Add To – Start Unknown):** *“Juanita has just been given $3 by her grandmother. She now has $8. How much did she have before?”* | **Standard(s):** **2.OA.1** – “adding to” scenarios with the start amount unknown ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). This is a one-step problem where students work backwards to find the initial quantity, a situation explicitly included in the standard (*unknowns in all positions*).<br>**Notes:** This problem type (start unknown) is typically more challenging for second graders, but it falls under the Grade 2 expectations. Students might model it with counters or an equation like □ + 3 = 8. Solving it reinforces the relationship between addition and subtraction: they learn that they can subtract 3 from 8 to find the missing starting amount. Mastering such problems demonstrates flexibility in understanding addition and subtraction – a key goal by end of Grade 2. ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem))<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“After Juanita’s grandma gave her $4, Juanita now has $10. **How much money did Juanita have before** her grandma gave her the $4?”* (Different numbers, same structure: find the unknown start by subtracting 4 from 10. This lets students practice the start-unknown format with accessible numbers.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.8** – we embed the start-unknown problem in a larger context that requires two steps ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3.%20OA.8%20Solve%20two,digit%20arithmetic)). The third grader not only finds the initial amount but then uses it in a subsequent operation, reflecting multi-step reasoning.<br>**Notes:** For a third grader, solving the start unknown (as in Juanita’s scenario) is usually straightforward by this stage. We extend the task by having Juanita spend or use some money afterwards, which means the student must first find the initial amount and then perform an additional subtraction. This two-step sequence aligns with 3.OA.8 and highlights the need to keep track of an intermediate result. It also gives an opportunity to set up an equation like “□ + 3 = 8, then □ – 3 = ?” or simply logical reasoning in two parts. The arithmetic stays within manageable ranges, exercising 3.NBT.2 (fluency within 1000) in a simple way.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Juanita’s grandma gave her $4, and now Juanita has $10. **How much money did Juanita have before** she got money from grandma? After that, Juanita spent $3 on a toy. **How much money does she have left now?**”* (Students first find Juanita had $6 originally, then subtract $3 to find she has $3 remaining. This compound scenario requires them to handle an unknown-start addition and a subsequent subtraction, demonstrating third-grade multi-step problem solving.) |
| **Basic Word Problem (Take From – Change Unknown):** *“Robert had 8 marbles before playing with Ruth. He now has 3 marbles. How many did he lose (give away) during the game?”* | **Standard(s):** **2.OA.1** – “taking from” scenarios with the change (amount removed) unknown ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). This is a classic one-step subtraction situation where the result and initial are known but the amount taken is unknown.<br>**Notes:** This fits the *“taking from (change unknown)”* category: 8 – □ = 3. Second graders solve it by finding the difference 8–3. It helps reinforce the concept that subtraction can be used to find an unknown addend (here, the marbles lost). It’s within the expectation that students can handle such inverse problems (using subtraction to find how many were taken) with totals up to 20. The problem builds understanding of the relationship between addition and subtraction in a real context (if 5 were lost, then 3 + 5 = 8).<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Robert had 20 marbles. After playing with his friend, he has 13 marbles left. **How many marbles did Robert lose?**”* (Students compute 20 – 13 to find 7 marbles lost. This uses a slightly larger number while keeping the structure the same, reinforcing Grade 2 subtraction skills.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.8** – expanded to a two-step scenario ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3.%20OA.8%20Solve%20two,digit%20arithmetic)). We take the basic “find how many lost” problem and add a second step to align with multi-step problem solving in grade 3.<br>**Notes:** Third graders easily determine how many marbles were lost (as a single-step problem). The extension is to introduce a follow-up event, such as finding some of the lost marbles. This requires them to take the result from the first step (number lost) and then adjust it, providing practice with sequential reasoning. It meets 3.OA.8 by requiring two calculations in context. The arithmetic (within 20 or 100) is simple, but the ability to carry information from one step to the next is a key third-grade skill. This also touches on understanding subtraction in a deeper way (removing something, then partially adding back), which they can handle at this level.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Robert had 20 marbles. After playing with a friend, he has 13 marbles now. **How many marbles did Robert lose?** Later, he finds 2 of the marbles he lost under the couch. **How many of his marbles are still missing?**”* (First, students find that Robert lost 7 marbles. Then they subtract the 2 that were recovered, leaving 5 still lost. This two-step problem engages third graders in updating their result and is in line with the complexity of 3rd-grade word problems.) |
| **Basic Word Problem (Compare – Difference Unknown):** *“Susan has $3 in her pocket. Claire has $8. How much less does Susan have than Claire?”* | **Standard(s):** **2.OA.1** – compare problems with an unknown difference ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). This one-step subtraction fits the “compare” category: the question “how much less?” indicates a difference to be found between two known quantities.<br>**Notes:** In Grade 2, students interpret “how much less” or “how many more” as a subtraction. This problem (Claire has 8, Susan has 3) prompts them to compute 8 – 3 to find the difference. It aligns perfectly with 2.OA.1, which includes comparing quantities as one of the problem types. By solving it, students demonstrate understanding that subtraction can represent the difference between two numbers. This builds their ability to tackle comparison questions, which is a critical part of the Grade 2 problem-solving repertoire.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Susan has $15 and Claire has $22. **How much less money does Susan have than Claire?**”* (Students calculate 22 – 15 = 7. The numbers are larger than the original but still within Grade 2 capabilities, providing practice in the same compare-difference structure.) | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.8** – extended to two steps ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3.%20OA.8%20Solve%20two,digit%20arithmetic)). We increase the complexity by adding another change to one of the quantities, turning the simple comparison into a multi-step problem as expected in Grade 3.<br>**Notes:** A third grader can solve the initial comparison easily (difference between Claire’s and Susan’s amounts). The extended task might then change Claire’s or Susan’s money and ask for a new comparison. This multi-step evolution aligns with 3.OA.8 because the student must integrate the initial subtraction with an additional operation (another addition or subtraction). It provides an opportunity to set up an equation or simply reason through sequentially: first find the initial difference, then update based on the new information. The numbers can be larger (still within their fluency range per 3.NBT.2) to keep the arithmetic appropriate for third grade.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“Susan has $15 and Claire has $22. **How much less money does Susan have than Claire?** Then Claire’s mom gives her an extra $5. **Now how much more money does Claire have than Susan?**”* (Initially, students find the $7 difference. After Claire’s money increases to $27, students find the new difference is $12. This requires them to do two steps: one subtraction for the first question and another subtraction after updating Claire’s amount, exemplifying a multi-step compare problem for grade 3.) |
| **Composite Multi-Stage Problem (“Number 7” Roles):** *“At a school fair, a special game is played in four rounds. The number **7** is important in each round, but in a different way each time:*<br> **Round 1:** Emma ended up with 7 stickers after a trade.<br> **Round 2:** Noah began the round with 7 stickers.<br> **Round 3:** Olivia received a bonus of 7 stickers added to her collection.<br> **Round 4:** The difference between the number of stickers traded in two consecutive moves was 7.”* | **Standard(s):** **2.OA.1** – solving one-step problems in various contexts (adding to, taking from, etc.) ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/2011/07/07/2nd_Math.pdf#:~:text=2,number%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). Each part of this composite involves a one-step scenario that is accessible to Grade 2: Round1 is an *“end unknown”* problem, Round2 a trivial *“start”* given, Round3 a straightforward *“change (added) unknown”*, and Round4 is more complex (a difference of differences) which is beyond Grade 2. We would focus on the first three rounds for alignment.<br>**Notes:** By interpreting each round as a separate simple word problem, second graders practice multiple problem types outlined in 2.OA.1. For example, they might consider a simpler version of Round1: “Emma had some stickers and after trading she has 7” (find how many traded or started with), Round2 is just stating a start amount (no solving needed), Round3: “Olivia had X stickers and then got 7 more, now she has Y” (find Y), which is an “add to” problem. Round4’s concept of comparing two trades is too advanced for Grade 2 and would likely be omitted or left for teacher discussion. Overall, this composite encourages recognizing how the same number can play different roles in problem contexts, a deep understanding that is budding at this stage.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“At a class fair, the number **5** is special in each round of a game:<br> **Round 1:** After a trade, Sam has 5 marbles.<br> **Round 2:** Alex starts Round 2 with 5 marbles.<br> **Round 3:** Jamie gets a bonus of 5 extra marbles.<br>*(Round 4 is omitted for second grade.)*”*<br>*For each of the first three rounds, students can be asked: what could the story be and what question could we ask? (e.g., Round1 could ask “If Sam ended with 5 marbles after trading, how many did he trade for?”)* This reformulation uses a smaller number (5) and only three rounds, making it accessible for second graders to discuss different simple problem types (end result known, start known, change known) without the complexity of the fourth round.* | **Standard(s):** **3.OA.8** – multi-step problem solving ([](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Year/2011/07/07/3rd_Math.pdf?rev=949d27ea38db4ad4afa777217fd0b3a9#:~:text=3.%20OA.8%20Solve%20two,digit%20arithmetic)). The composite problem as given is more of a problem-posing or analysis task, but if turned into a solvable multi-part problem, a third grader could tackle it as a series of connected steps. In particular, Round4’s condition introduces a two-step reasoning (finding two trade values differing by 7), which is aligned with 3.OA.8’s complexity. Additionally, identifying the recurring “7” in different roles touches on **3.OA.9** (explaining patterns) insofar as students recognize a theme in the number’s usage.<br>**Notes:** In third grade, students could treat each round as a sub-problem: for example, determine possible scenarios that fit Round1, Round2, Round3, and then Round4 requires a multi-step solution (e.g., “two trades differ by 7” could be solved by picking one trade amount and adding/subtracting 7 to get the other). This composite exercise goes beyond simply computing answers – it asks students to understand the *structure* of problems. By Grade 3, they can appreciate that the same number (7) can be a result, an initial value, an added amount, or a difference. Engaging with this understanding reflects a higher-order alignment with both 3.OA.8 (solving and reasoning through multi-part situations) and the mathematical practice of looking for structure (MP7). It effectively prepares them for algebraic thinking by highlighting how conditions in different rounds relate to equations or differences.<br>**Reformulated Problem:** *“In a four-round game, the number **7** appears in a different way each round. For example:<br>– In one round, a player **ends up with 7** points.<br>– In another round, a player **starts with 7** points.<br>– In another, a player **gains 7** points as a bonus.<br>– In another round, the **difference** between two players’ scores is 7.<br>Discuss or determine possible values that could fit each situation (for instance, what the starting amount might have been in the first case, or what two scores differ by 7).”* (This prompts third graders to consider and solve each part. Round4 in particular would require a two-step reasoning: if two scores differ by 7, and one example score is given, find the other – a direct application of a two-step subtraction/addition. This composite problem fosters a deeper understanding of word problem structures in line with 3rd grade expectations.) |
