| *“John had 8 candies, he eats 3 of them. How many candies does he have now?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=Problem%201%3A%20John%20had%208,many%20candies%20does%20he%20have))   | *Number –* **Combining/Partitioning within 0–10:** *“Partition sets of objects 0–10… 8 people are on my team. 6 are girls, how many are boys?”* ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20partition%20sets%20of%20objects%2C,and%20exploratory%20work%20has%20been)) | This problem requires subtracting 3 from 8, aligning with the Senior Infants outcome of understanding subtraction as “taking away” within 10. Children at this level learn to count how many items are left when some are removed ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20partition%20sets%20of%20objects%2C,and%20exploratory%20work%20has%20been)), which is exactly what this task practices. | **John had 8** **sweets**. He **ate 3** of them. **How many sweets does he have now?** (Use counters or drawings to take away 3 from 8.) |
| *“Juanita has just been given $3 by her grandmother. She now has $8. How many dollars did she have before?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=Problem%203%3A%20Juanita%20has%20just,How)) | *Number –* **Combining to Total (Counting on):** *“Combine sets of objects, totals to 10… use appropriate strategies: counting all, counting on (e.g. start at 5, count on 3)….”* ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=Combining%20%E2%80%A2%20explore%20the%20components,more%20sets%2C%20state%20total%20record)) | This addition scenario presents a total (8) and a part (3) to find the unknown initial amount. It aligns with the curriculum goal of combining numbers up to 10 ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=Combining%20%E2%80%A2%20explore%20the%20components,more%20sets%2C%20state%20total%20record)). Solving it reinforces that adding 3 to the starting number gives 8, building understanding of addition and its inverse (subtraction) in a real-life context. | **Juanita had some sweets.** Her granny **gave her 3 more**, and now **she has 8 sweets in total**. **How many sweets did Juanita have at first?** (Children can use objects to count up to 8, having added 3.) |
| *“Susan has $3 in her pocket. Claire has $8. How much less does Susan have?”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=Problem%205%3A%20Susan%20has%20%243,much%20less%20does%20Susan%20have))    | *Number –* **Comparing Numbers (0–10):** *“Compare equivalent and non-equivalent sets 0–10 by matching; name the inequality: I have 2 more than you; 3 is less than 5.”* ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20compare%20equivalent%20and%20non,describe%20position%20in%20a%20line))        | This comparative question addresses the concept of difference between two quantities. Senior Infants are expected to compare numbers within 10 and describe one amount as “more than” or “less than” another ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20compare%20equivalent%20and%20non,describe%20position%20in%20a%20line)). Figuring out how many more sweets Claire has (or how many fewer Susan has) directly practices this skill of comparing and quantifying the difference. | **Susan has 3 sweets and Claire has 8 sweets. How many more sweets does Claire have than Susan?** (Children might line up objects or use counting to see the difference.) |
| *“Add 3 to a number.”*                                           | *Algebra –* **Extending Patterns:** *“Recognise patterns and predict subsequent numbers… find the missing numbers: 2, 3, 4, ■, 6, 7.”* ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=how%20many%20different%20patterns%20of,3%2C%20%E2%96%A0%20%2C%20%E2%96%A0))           | This prompt is about a constant increasing pattern (each term 3 greater than the last). It reflects the early algebraic thinking in Senior Infants, where children identify and extend number patterns and sequences ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=how%20many%20different%20patterns%20of,3%2C%20%E2%96%A0%20%2C%20%E2%96%A0)). By adding 3 each time, pupils practice predicting “what comes next” in a pattern, a key skill in the algebra strand at this level. | **Mary picks 3 apples each day.** On day 1 she picked 3 apples, on day 2 she picked 6 apples, on day 3 she picked 9 apples. **If this pattern continues, how many apples will she pick on day 4?** (Recognize that the number increases by 3 each day.) |
| *“How many unique triangles are made by the six lines below? (One example triangle is shown in bold.)”* ([ALL_Problem_Sets.pdf](file://file-L92gJhKTDD2FUTEk4uHgsd#:~:text=5,one)) | *Shape and Space –* **2D Shapes (Senior Infants):** *“Sort, describe and name 2-D shapes: square, circle, triangle, rectangle…; solve problems involving shape and space.”* ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20sort%2C%20describe%20and%20name,4%20pieces%20and%20discuss%20the)) | The original is a complex geometry puzzle. For Senior Infants, the focus shifts to basic shape recognition and simple spatial reasoning. The curriculum expects children to identify and name common shapes (like triangles) and to solve simple shape problems ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20sort%2C%20describe%20and%20name,4%20pieces%20and%20discuss%20the)). By reformulating, we ensure the task involves recognizing triangles and counting or sorting shapes – fundamentals of geometry at this age – rather than advanced counting of overlapping shapes. | **Amy has 4 paper shapes: 2 triangles, 1 circle, and 1 square.** She makes a group of all the shapes that **have 3 sides**. **Which shapes will go in that group, and how many shapes are not in the group?** (Children identify the triangles as the 3-sided shapes, and count those vs. the others.) |
| *“More than one but finitely many solutions.”*                       | *Skills –* **Problem Solving (Applying and Problem-Solving):** *“Solve simple oral and pictorial problems, 0–10… problems can include … open-ended exploratory questions (e.g. *How many different ways can you make a pattern with 6 counters?*).”* ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20solve%20simple%20oral%20and,a%20pattern%20with%206%20counters)) | This open-ended prompt encourages finding multiple answers, which ties into the problem-solving skills emphasized in the curriculum. Senior Infants are given exploratory tasks with numbers within 10 ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20solve%20simple%20oral%20and,a%20pattern%20with%206%20counters)). Reformulating it as a concrete scenario with small numbers allows children to explore and find **all** possible solutions (an important aspect of mathematical thinking) while staying within their number range. | **Billy has 5 apples and 2 baskets.** He can put some apples in the red basket and the rest in the blue basket. **What different ways can Billy put the 5 apples into the two baskets?** (Children attempt all possible splits of 5, e.g. 0&5, 1&4, 2&3, etc., using counters to help.) |
