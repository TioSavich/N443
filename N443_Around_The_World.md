# Indiana (Grades K–5)  
- **Standards Documents:** Indiana’s **Academic Standards for Mathematics** (K–5) detail grade-level content in domains like number sense, algebraic thinking, geometry, and data. Each grade’s standards are published by the Indiana Dept. of Education (IDOE) and are supplemented by “Process Standards” (Indiana’s term for the mathematical practice standards) ([DOE: Mathematics](https://www.in.gov/doe/students/indiana-academic-standards/mathematics/#:~:text=The%20Indiana%20Academic%20Standards%20for,synthesize%20and%20apply%20mathematical%20skills)). The Process Standards describe how students should develop understanding and apply math skills, mirroring the eight Standards for Mathematical Practice ([DOE: Mathematics](https://www.in.gov/doe/students/indiana-academic-standards/mathematics/#:~:text=each%20domain%20indicate%20what%20students,synthesize%20and%20apply%20mathematical%20skills)). IDOE provides the K–5 standards in downloadable grade-specific documents ([DOE: Mathematics](https://www.in.gov/doe/students/indiana-academic-standards/mathematics/#:~:text=Correlation%20Guides%202023%20IAS%2FCCSS%20Correlation,6%20PDF%20PDF%20%2093PDF)), and also offers correlation guides showing alignment between Indiana’s 2020 standards and Common Core ([DOE: Mathematics](https://www.in.gov/doe/students/indiana-academic-standards/mathematics/#:~:text=Standards%202020%20Standards%202020%2F2023%20IAS,5%20PDF%20PDF%20%2089PDF)).  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** Indiana has released **Math Frameworks (2023)** through the Indiana Learning Lab, which give instructional guidance for the K–5 standards ([Collections - Indiana Learning Lab](https://inlearninglab.com/collections?tags[]=IDOE+Framework#:~:text=Collections%20,5%20grades%206)). These frameworks (organized for grades K–2 and 3–5) include examples, clarifications, and teaching tips to help educators implement the standards. Additionally, IDOE’s website and Indiana Learning Lab host lesson ideas and “I Can” statements for each standard. For example, the Indiana Learning Lab collection for Math 2023 provides frameworks and resources aligned to the updated standards ([Collections - Indiana Learning Lab](https://inlearninglab.com/collections?tags[]=IDOE+Framework#:~:text=Collections%20,5%20grades%206)).  

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** The **Indiana Process Standards** emphasize mathematical practices (problem-solving, reasoning, modeling, etc.) and are intended to be integrated into daily instruction ([DOE: Mathematics](https://www.in.gov/doe/students/indiana-academic-standards/mathematics/#:~:text=each%20domain%20indicate%20what%20students,synthesize%20and%20apply%20mathematical%20skills)). IDOE’s teacher resource guides (e.g. a 2014 Standards Resource Guide) offer strategies for teaching each standard and ensuring process standards are addressed in elementary classrooms. While Indiana’s state math assessment (ILEARN) begins at Grade 3, IDOE provides **assessment blueprints** and item samplers that indicate how content standards are evaluated. Educators also use formative assessments aligned to the K–5 standards (often included in the frameworks or guides) to monitor student progress.

# Ireland (1st Grade)  
- **Standards Documents:** Ireland’s primary mathematics curriculum is outlined in the **Primary School Mathematics Curriculum (1999)** and recently updated in the **Primary Mathematics Curriculum (2023)**. The 1999 curriculum defines content for *First Class* (equivalent to 1st grade) across five strands: Number, Algebra, Shape & Space, Measures, and Data ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=The%20structure%20of%20the%20curriculum,separate%20sections%2C%20are%20not%20isolated)). It provides specific learning objectives for first class under each strand (e.g. counting, place value, addition/subtraction within 99, basic measures) ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=The%20child%20should%20be%20enabled,numerals%20to%20correspond%20to%20sets)). In 2023, a revised curriculum was introduced by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) to modernize these standards ([Mathematics | Curriculum Online](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/primary/curriculum-areas/mathematics/#:~:text=Primary%20Mathematics%20Curriculum)), though the structure (strand concepts) remains similar. Both the 1999 and 2023 curriculum documents are official and available on Curriculum Online ([Mathematics | Curriculum Online](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/primary/curriculum-areas/mathematics/#:~:text=,179)).  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** Alongside the curriculum, the NCCA provided **Teacher Guidelines (1999)** for Mathematics ([Mathematics | Curriculum Online](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/primary/curriculum-areas/mathematics/#:~:text=,179)), which serve as a curriculum guide. These guidelines elaborate on teaching approaches, use of concrete materials, and integration of math across subjects for each topic in first class. With the 2023 curriculum, NCCA has launched a **Primary Mathematics Toolkit** ([Mathematics | Curriculum Online](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/primary/curriculum-areas/mathematics/#:~:text=Welcome%20to%20the%20Primary%20Mathematics,all%20Primary%20and%20Special%20schools)) offering sample activities, planning tools, and explanatory videos for teachers. The toolkit and curriculum online platform include resources like navigation videos, an interactive planning tool, and guidance on linking content to real-life contexts.  

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** Problem-solving and active learning are central to Ireland’s math standards. The curriculum (1999) encourages a constructivist, hands-on approach – for example, using manipulatives for number concepts and emphasizing the development of reasoning and estimation skills ([](https://www.curriculumonline.ie/getmedia/9df5f3c5-257b-471e-8d0f-f2cf059af941/PSEC02_Mathematics_Curriculum.pdf#:~:text=It%20should%20be%20recognised%20that,should%20be%20sufficiently%20flexible%20to)). The Teacher Guidelines suggest strategies such as guided discussion, real-world problem contexts, and differentiation to meet varying abilities. In terms of assessment, teachers use curriculum-aligned checklists and tasks to assess first-class students’ mastery of each content objective (Ireland does not have standardized testing at 1st grade). The Department of Education provides some **assessment guidelines** through its support services (e.g. diagnostic tests for early numeracy), and the new 2023 curriculum framework includes recommendations for ongoing formative assessment to inform teaching.

# Pennsylvania (1st Grade)  
- **Standards Documents:** Pennsylvania’s 1st grade math standards are part of the **PA Core Standards for Mathematics**. These standards (adopted in 2014) are closely aligned to the Common Core, covering content like addition and subtraction within 20, place value to 100, measurement of lengths, and defining simple shapes. The official PA Core Standards document includes both **Mathematical Content** and the eight **Standards for Mathematical Practice** ([](https://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/PA%20Core%20Standards%20Mathematics%20PreK-12%20March%202014.pdf#:~:text=This%20document%20includes%20PA%20Core,1%20Numbers%20and%20Operations)) ([](https://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/PA%20Core%20Standards%20Mathematics%20PreK-12%20March%202014.pdf#:~:text=F,of%20regularity%20in%20repeated%20reasoning)). For example, it enumerates first-grade content standards such as 1.OA (Operations & Algebraic Thinking) and 1.NBT (Number & Base Ten) and expects students to use addition and subtraction in various problem situations and understand two-digit place value ([](https://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/PA%20Core%20Standards%20Mathematics%20PreK-12%20March%202014.pdf#:~:text=CC,represent%20amounts%20of%20tens%20and)) ([](https://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/PA%20Core%20Standards%20Mathematics%20PreK-12%20March%202014.pdf#:~:text=CC.2.1.1.B.2%20Use%20place,value)). The practice standards (e.g. “Make sense of problems,” “Reason abstractly”) are listed in the introduction and are to be developed across all grade 1 activities ([](https://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/PA%20Core%20Standards%20Mathematics%20PreK-12%20March%202014.pdf#:~:text=F,of%20regularity%20in%20repeated%20reasoning)). The PA Department of Education (PDE) provides the full standards on its website and via the Standards Aligned System (SAS) portal ([](https://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/PA%20Core%20Standards%20Mathematics%20PreK-12%20March%202014.pdf#:~:text=PA%20CORE%20STANDARDS%20Mathematics%20,more%20demanding%20math%20concepts%20and)).  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** PDE’s **Standards Aligned System (SAS)** is an online portal that offers curriculum frameworks and resources aligned to the PA Core Standards. For grade 1 math, teachers can find **Instructional Frameworks** that break down the standards into units or clusters. PDE also offers a **Voluntary Model Curriculum**, which includes sample unit and lesson plans for early elementary math ([View Standards - SAS](https://www.pdesas.org/standard/view#:~:text=,POWER%20Library)). These model lessons illustrate how to teach the grade 1 standards (for example, a unit on addition strategies or understanding shapes). Additionally, the SAS portal provides **Learning Progressions** and **Assessment Anchors** – the latter mainly guide state assessments starting in grade 3, but they show the continuum of skills building from grade 1 upward. All these resources are official and designed to help educators implement the standards with fidelity.  

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** Pennsylvania emphasizes that the PA Core standards are not a set curriculum, so PDE encourages districts to use the standards as a framework for designing instruction ([](https://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/PA%20Core%20Standards%20Mathematics%20PreK-12%20March%202014.pdf#:~:text=demanding%20that%20students%20develop%20a,Mathematical%20Practice%20Standards)). Common teaching strategies for 1st grade include using manipulatives and visual models (number lines, base-ten blocks) for developing number sense and fluency. The **Standards for Mathematical Practice** are embedded – for instance, teachers prompt first graders to explain their reasoning (addressing Practice MP.3: construct arguments) or to look for patterns (MP.7). PDE provides **assessment guidance** through **Assessment Anchors/Eligible Content** (which outline how grade 1 skills will later be assessed on Grade 3 state tests) and through classroom diagnostic tools available on SAS. While there is no state test in math for 1st grade, many schools use standards-based checklists and performance tasks. PDE’s resources (like the **Grade 1 SAS Assessment** items) align with the standards to informally gauge student progress toward meeting the PA Core expectations.

# Kentucky (1st Grade)  
- **Standards Documents:** Kentucky’s 1st grade math standards are defined in the **Kentucky Academic Standards (KAS) for Mathematics** (adopted 2019). The KAS for Mathematics document includes both the specific Grade 1 content standards and the overarching **Standards for Mathematical Practice**. At the start of the grade 1 section, KAS lists all eight practice standards (MP.1 through MP.8) that students should develop (e.g. persevere in solving problems, reason abstractly, etc.) ([Grade 1 Mathematics Course Standards Document](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/701040_Primary_Mathematics_Grade_1_2019.pdf#:~:text=%E2%9E%A2Make%20sense%20of%20problems%20and,OA%20Operations%20and%20Algebraic%20Thinking)). The content standards for first grade cover operations and algebraic thinking (adding/subtracting within 20, understanding the relationship between addition and subtraction), number and operations in base ten (place value understanding for two-digit numbers), measurement and data (length measurement, time to the hour/half-hour, simple data representations), and geometry (reasoning about shapes and their attributes) ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20Represent%20and%20solve%20problems,%E2%80%A2%20Extend%20the%20counting%20sequence)) ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=In%20grade%201%2C%20instructional%20time,arithmetic%20problems%20with%20these%20operations)). The KAS document identifies “critical areas” of focus for 1st grade – for example, developing strategies for addition/subtraction and understanding place value ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=In%20grade%201%2C%20instructional%20time,arithmetic%20problems%20with%20these%20operations)). All of these standards are official and published by the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE).  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** KDE provides a robust support system on its **KY Standards** website (kystandards.org). For mathematics, there are grade-level **“Standards Overview” documents and deconstructions**. For instance, KDE publishes a Grade 1 **Course Standards Document** that aligns each KAS standard to the grade 1 math course ([Grade 1 Mathematics Course Standards Document](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/701040_Primary_Mathematics_Grade_1_2019.pdf#:~:text=Grade%20level%3A%201%20Course%20standards,should%20be%20able%20to%3A%20Standards)) ([Grade 1 Mathematics Course Standards Document](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/701040_Primary_Mathematics_Grade_1_2019.pdf#:~:text=1,sum%20is%20less%20than%20or)). This includes a brief description of each expectation and how it might be assessed. Additionally, Kentucky offers **Standards Implementation Guides** and **Instructional Resources** for math ([KY Academic Standards – KYstandards](https://kystandards.org/home/ky-acad-standards/#:~:text=,17)). These resources help teachers break down each standard, suggesting instructional strategies and examples. The state also provides **Family Guides** for each grade (available on the KY Standards site) to communicate what students will learn by the end of 1st grade ([[PDF] GRADE 1! - A Family's Guide to the Kentucky Academic Standards](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/Grade_1_KAS_Family_Guide.pdf#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20GRADE%201%21%20,the%20end%20of%201st%20grade)).  

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** The Kentucky Academic Standards stress not only what first graders should learn, but **how** they should engage with math. The KAS document frequently includes **“Attending to the Standards for Mathematical Practice”** notes within grade 1 standards, which give teachers guidance on engaging students in practices like reasoning and modeling while learning content ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=Attending%20to%20the%20Standards%20for,When%20reading%2Finterpreting%20word)) ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=Attending%20to%20the%20Standards%20for,combined%20does%20not%20affect%20the)). For example, as first graders learn 1.OA (operations and algebraic thinking), the documents suggest having students explain their reasoning (addressing MP.3) or use tools like number lines (MP.5) in age-appropriate ways. In terms of assessment, Kentucky’s statewide testing begins in grade 3, but for K–2 the **Continuous Classroom Assessment** is encouraged. KDE has not mandated specific tests for 1st grade, but they provide **common benchmark assessments** aligned to KAS (through initiatives like K-2 formative assessment modules). Teachers often use the KAS and its expanded explanations to create exit slips, checkpoints, or performance tasks. Overall, Kentucky’s official guidance emphasizes conceptual understanding and procedural skill together, preparing students for rigorous assessment in later grades ([Kentucky Academic Standards Mathematics](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/First_Grade_Cluster_SMP_Activity.pdf#:~:text=In%20grade%201%2C%20instructional%20time,arithmetic%20problems%20with%20these%20operations)) ([Grade 1 Mathematics Course Standards Document](https://www.education.ky.gov/curriculum/standards/kyacadstand/Documents/701040_Primary_Mathematics_Grade_1_2019.pdf#:~:text=%E2%9E%A2Make%20sense%20of%20problems%20and,OA%20Operations%20and%20Algebraic%20Thinking)).

# Tennessee (Grades 1 and 4)  
- **Standards Documents:** Tennessee’s math standards for elementary grades (implemented in 2017 after a thorough review) are compiled in the **Tennessee Academic Standards for Mathematics**. These standards were developed by Tennessee educators and include grade-specific expectations as well as the **Standards for Mathematical Practice**. The eight mathematical practice standards (e.g. make sense of problems, reason abstractly, etc.) are explicitly listed in the TN standards documentation ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=Standards%20for%20Mathematical%20Practice%201,critique%20the%20reasoning%20of%20others)), emphasizing the habits of mind students should build alongside content. For **Grade 1**, the Tennessee standards focus on four critical areas: developing understanding of addition and subtraction (and strategies within 20), understanding the relationship between addition and subtraction, extending the counting sequence, and understanding place value for two-digit numbers ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=Operations%20and%20Algebraic%20Thinking%20Students,Students)) ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=needed%20%28See%20Table%203%20,and%20Operations%20in%20Base%20Ten)). By the end of 1st grade, students are expected to know all sums to 10 from memory and be fluent adding/subtracting within 20 ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=Situations%29,equations%20to%20represent%20a%20given)). For **Grade 4**, the standards emphasize multi-digit arithmetic (fluently adding/subtracting large numbers, and multiplying/dividing multi-digit numbers), deepening understanding of fractions (equivalence, addition/subtraction with like denominators, multiplying a fraction by a whole number), and geometry concepts like classifying shapes and understanding angles ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=nearest%20hundred%20thousand%2C%20which%20builds,digit)) ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=Students%20continue%20to%20develop%20an,contextual%20problems%20involving%20addition%20and)). All Tennessee math standards are available on the TN Department of Education website as a comprehensive document ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=The%20Process%20The%20Tennessee%20State,higher%20education%20reviewed%20each%20standard)) ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=The%20result%20is%20Tennessee%20Math,work%20with%20simple%20fractions%20and)).  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** The Tennessee Department of Education provides **Instructional Focus Documents (IFDs)** for each grade, which are a key resource for teachers. For example, the **Grade 1 Math Instructional Focus Document** outlines each state standard, offers “Evidence of Learning” statements (descriptions of what student mastery looks like), and **Instructional Focus Statements** that suggest effective teaching strategies ([Grade 1 Math Instructional Focus Documents](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/education/standards/math/Standards_Support_grade_1_Mathematics.pdf#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20this%20document,level%20conceptual)) ([Grade 1 Math Instructional Focus Documents](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/education/standards/math/Standards_Support_grade_1_Mathematics.pdf#:~:text=Instructional%20focus%20statements%20provide%20guidance,Revised%20July%2031%2C%202019%201)). These IFDs help teachers understand the progression of content and how to scaffold instruction from basic to advanced understanding. In addition, Tennessee’s **Best for All Central** platform (an official repository) offers lesson plans and curricular materials aligned to the standards ([BFAC | Academic Standards | Math - Best for All Central](https://bestforall.tnedu.gov/academic-standards/math#:~:text=BFAC%20,verbal%20explanations%2C%20expressions%2C%20or)). For instance, there are sample tasks and videos demonstrating first-grade addition strategies or fourth-grade fraction lessons, all tied to TN standards. The state also provides **mathematics vocabulary lists** and suggested **pacing guides** to ensure all grade 1 and 4 standards are taught before year-end. 

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** Tennessee’s standards emphasize a balance of conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, and application ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=A%20college%20and%20career%20ready,mathematically%20proficient%2C%20the%20standards%20focus)). Teachers in grade 1 and 4 are encouraged to use manipulatives (counters, base-ten blocks, fraction models) and real-world scenarios to build understanding. The TN math practices (embedded from the 8 SMPs) guide instructional strategies: for example, **Math Practice 3** (construct arguments) might involve first graders explaining their solution to an addition problem or fourth graders critiquing a peer’s method for a multi-digit multiplication. The **Evidence of Learning** levels in the IFDs also serve as an assessment guide – they describe what a student at performance Level 3 (on-grade mastery) or Level 4 (above grade level) can do for each standard ([Grade 1 Math Instructional Focus Documents](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/education/standards/math/Standards_Support_grade_1_Mathematics.pdf#:~:text=divided%20into%20either%20four%20or,defined%20by%20the%20Tennessee%20academic)) ([Grade 1 Math Instructional Focus Documents](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/education/standards/math/Standards_Support_grade_1_Mathematics.pdf#:~:text=standards,Mathematics%20Standards%20will%20most%20likely)). Tennessee does not have a state test for 1st grade, but it does for 3-5. However, it offers an optional Grade 2 assessment portfolio and **Grade 1 portfolio** (for alternative evaluation), which align to the seven-level performance statements in the IFD ([Grade 1 Math Instructional Focus Documents](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/education/standards/math/Standards_Support_grade_1_Mathematics.pdf#:~:text=how%20students%20are%20tracking%20towards,of%20the%20portfolio%20scoring%20rubric)). By 4th grade, students will face the TNReady assessment; accordingly, TDOE publishes **assessment blueprints** that show how grade 4 standards (like multi-digit operations and fraction understanding) are weighted. Teachers use these blueprints and IFDs to inform both instruction and the design of classroom assessments, ensuring alignment with state expectations.

# Wyoming (Grades K–2)  
- **Standards Documents:** Wyoming’s math standards for elementary grades are outlined in the **Wyoming Content and Performance Standards 2021** (WYCPS) for Mathematics. The K–2 standards in Wyoming are built on the Common Core framework – they are organized by familiar domains such as Counting & Cardinality (for Kindergarten), Operations & Algebraic Thinking, Number & Operations in Base Ten, Measurement & Data, and Geometry ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=Key%3A%20K,HS%20%E2%80%93%20Geometry%20%28G)). The standards specify what students should know and be able to do by the end of each grade. For example, by end of Grade 1 students are expected to **use addition and subtraction within 20 to solve all types of word problems** and understand place value in two-digit numbers ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=GRADE%201%20MATH%20PERFORMANCE%20STANDARDS,together%2C%20taking%20apart%2C%20and%20comparing)) ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=Grade%201%20Math%20Content%20%26,and%20persevere%20in%20solving%20them)). Each grade’s section in the standards document clearly enumerates these content standards. Wyoming also formally includes the **Standards for Mathematical Practice** (SMP) as part of its standards framework – the 2021 standards list all eight SMP (MP1 through MP8) as “habits of mind” that students should develop in every grade ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=STANDARDS%20FOR%20MATHEMATICAL%20PRACTICES%201,express%20regularity%20in%20repeated%20reasoning)). These practices (problem-solving, reasoning, precision, etc.) are expected to be integrated with K–2 content. The official standards document is available via the Wyoming Dept. of Education and includes both content standards and an explanation of how to read the coding of each standard ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=ORGANIZATION%20OF%20THE%20STANDARDS%3A%20,NBT)).  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** Wyoming provides a combined approach in its standards document by pairing **Content Standards** with **Performance Standards and Level Descriptors**. For each content standard in K–2, the document offers **Performance Level Descriptors (PLDs)** that describe what student performance looks like at varying levels of proficiency (Advanced, Proficient, Basic, Below Basic) ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=standards,They%20specify%20the%20degree%20of)). These descriptors act as a guide for curriculum and assessment, helping teachers understand the depth to which a standard should be taught. In terms of curriculum resources, the Wyoming Department of Education often refers educators to the **Common Core instructional resources** (since WYCPS closely mirror CCSS). Wyoming’s standards page also sometimes shares instructional resources or links (for example, to resources from other CCSS-adopting states) given the overlap. Each school district in WY develops or selects its own K–2 math curriculum, but they use the state standards and PLDs as a guide to ensure coverage and rigor. The WDE has published **professional development modules** when new standards were released (e.g., training on the 2021 Math Standards), which include guidance on effective strategies for teaching early numeracy and operations.

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** The inclusion of **Performance Standards** and PLDs in Wyoming’s standards document provides built-in assessment guidance. For instance, a Grade 1 performance standard might state that a proficient student can *“use addition/subtraction within 20 to solve word problems of all types”*, whereas an advanced student can do so with more complex numbers or reasoning ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=GRADE%201%20MATH%20PERFORMANCE%20STANDARDS,together%2C%20taking%20apart%2C%20and%20comparing)). Teachers can use these descriptors to design assessments and to gauge student levels. In the classroom, Wyoming encourages hands-on, exploratory learning for K–2 math, aligned with the Standards for Mathematical Practice. Students are often engaged in counting games, story problems, and shape explorations to meet the content standards while practicing reasoning (MP2) and modeling (MP4). The state assessments for math begin at grade 3 (Wyoming’s WY-TOPP), but K–2 teachers use the **district assessment systems** guided by the state’s performance standards ([2021 Math WYCPS + PLDs](https://edu.wyoming.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2021-Math-WYCPS-PLDs-2.pdf#:~:text=PERFORMANCE%20STANDARDS%20,%E2%80%9D)). Many districts implement short quizzes and observational checklists derived from the WYCPS to monitor K–2 progress. Overall, Wyoming’s official guidance (via the standards and PLDs) ensures that by the end of grade 2, students are prepared in foundational skills and mathematical practices for the rigor of later grades.

# Michigan (Grades 2–3)  
- **Standards Documents:** Michigan’s math standards for grades 2 and 3 are part of the **Michigan K–12 Academic Standards for Mathematics**, which are effectively Michigan’s adoption of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). The state adopted these standards in 2010 and they remain in use, defining what 2nd and 3rd graders should learn in math. The standards emphasize key content such as extending understanding of base-ten place value, building fluency with addition and subtraction (for grade 2), and developing understanding of multiplication, division, and fractions (by grade 3) ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/mde/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9&hash=E928B99608A2C6642EA3E19E67CCCD39#:~:text=mathematics%20,4)). For example, **Grade 2** standards focus on four critical areas: (1) extending base-ten notation (understanding place value to 1000), (2) building fluency in addition/subtraction within 100, (3) using standard units of measure, and (4) describing and analyzing shapes ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/mde/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9&hash=E928B99608A2C6642EA3E19E67CCCD39#:~:text=mathematics%20,4)). **Grade 3** standards introduce multiplication/division within 100, fraction understanding (as numbers on the number line), and larger geometric and measurement concepts. Michigan’s standards document also includes the **Standards for Mathematical Practice**, the same eight practices from CCSS, which describe mathematical “habits of mind” for students (problem-solving, reasoning, argumentation, etc.) ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/mde/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9&hash=E928B99608A2C6642EA3E19E67CCCD39#:~:text=The%20Standards%20for%20Mathematical%20Practice,%E2%80%9Cprocesses%20and%20proficiencies%E2%80%9D%20with%20longstanding)). All official standards can be found in a single PDF on the Michigan Dept. of Education site ([Michigan Math Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/mde/-/media/Project/Websites/mde/Literacy/Content-Standards/Math_Standards.pdf?rev=1e793e2b1e314e4fa1abc754251b5dc9&hash=E928B99608A2C6642EA3E19E67CCCD39#:~:text=The%20Standards%20begin%20on%20page,4)), often referred to as “Michigan K-12 Math Standards (2010)” – though the content is identical to CCSS, the document carries Michigan branding.  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** The Michigan Department of Education (MDE) does not prescribe a state-wide curriculum, but it provides resources to help districts implement the standards. On the MDE website, along with the standards document, there are references to tools like **Achieve’s EQuIP rubrics and EdReports** for evaluating math instructional materials ([Early Literacy - Content Standards](https://www.michigan.gov/mde/services/academic-standards/literacy/early-literacy-content-standards#:~:text=,Literacy%20Development%20and%20Science%20Instruction)). These are meant to guide schools in choosing curricula aligned to the standards. Additionally, many Intermediate School Districts in Michigan collaborated to develop the **MAISA (Michigan Association of ISDs) Math Curriculum Units**, which break down the CCSS/Michigan standards into unit plans for each grade (these units, while not an official MDE product, are widely used and align with the state standards). MDE has also shared **Early Mathematics Assessment** tools and training as part of its early literacy and numeracy initiative, helping teachers in grades K–3 assess and support foundational skills. All these resources support the content standards by providing scope and sequence suggestions and sample activities, ensuring that the grade 2–3 standards are taught coherently across the state.  

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** Because Michigan’s standards closely follow Common Core, the teaching strategies encouraged are those validated by CCSS. In grades 2 and 3, this means using plenty of visual models (e.g., base-ten blocks for place value, arrays and grouping for multiplication, fraction pies or bars for simple fractions) and encouraging student discussion about math reasoning. Michigan emphasizes the **Mathematical Practices** – for instance, 2nd graders might **construct arguments** (MP.3) by explaining how they know 17+5=22 using a drawing, or 3rd graders might **model with mathematics** (MP.4) by representing a multiplication story problem with an array or equation. While the state does not test 2nd graders with a summative exam, 3rd graders take the **M-STEP** math assessment. The M-STEP is aligned to the standards, so its blueprints essentially serve as assessment guidelines for grade 3 teachers, indicating which content areas (operations, fractions, etc.) are emphasized. MDE provides access to **released item samples** and claims for the M-STEP, which indirectly inform teachers of the expectations (for example, fluency in addition/subtraction by end of grade 2 is assumed in grade 3 test content). In everyday practice, Michigan teachers use formative assessments like exit tickets, unit tests, and performance tasks aligned to the standards (often derived from the MAISA units or district curriculum) to measure student progress in meeting the grade 2–3 content standards and practices.

# Illinois (Grades 2–4)  
- **Standards Documents:** Illinois has adopted the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics, which it refers to as the **Illinois Learning Standards (ILS) for Mathematics**. Therefore, the official 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade math standards in Illinois are virtually the Common Core standards for those grades. All the content standards – such as addition and subtraction within 100 and understanding base-ten up to 1000 in grade 2, multiplication/division facts and unit fractions in grade 3, and multi-digit operations and fraction equivalence in grade 4 – are included. The standards are typically published in a combined PDF or by grade-level booklets by the Illinois State Board of Education ([Standards and Courses - Illinois State Board of Education](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Standards-Courses.aspx#:~:text=The%20Illinois%20Learning%20Standards%20establish,each%20subject%20at%20each%20grade)) ([Math Standards.indb](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/math-standards.pdf#:~:text=In%20Grade%202%2C%20instructional%20time,2%29%20building%20fluency%20with)). For example, the **Grade 2 standards** explicitly list skills like using addition/subtraction within 100 to solve one- and two-step problems and knowing all sums of two one-digit numbers from memory ([Math Standards.indb](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/math-standards.pdf#:~:text=grade%202%20,step)). The **Grade 4 standards** include adding/subtracting multi-digit whole numbers fluently and understanding fraction equivalence and comparison ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=rd%20grade%20rounding%20concepts,a%20whole%20number%20up%20to)) ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=nearest%20hundred%20thousand%2C%20which%20builds,digit)). Illinois also includes the eight **Standards for Mathematical Practice** in its standards framework. These practices (called out in the CCSS introduction) are part of Illinois’ official standards and expected to be integrated at each grade; Illinois’s documentation emphasizes, for instance, that students at all grades should be able to **construct and critique arguments** and **model with math** ([[PDF] The New Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics Incorporating ...](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/Math_common_core_standards.pdf#:~:text=,clarify%20or%20improve%20the%20arguments)) ([[PDF] Dynamic Learning Maps: Illinois Common Core Essential Elements ...](https://www.isbe.net/Documents/cc-ee-math.pdf#:~:text=,fractions%20with%20denominators%202)). The ISBE website provides downloadable **grade-level Illinois Learning Standards books** for math ([Illinois Learning Standards - Oak Park Elementary School District 97](https://www.op97.org/teach-learn/illinois-learning-standards#:~:text=97%20www,you%20will%20begin%20to)), which contain both the content standards and explanations of the practice standards.  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** To support the implementation of the standards, the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) developed a **Model Mathematics Curriculum** project. Initially focused on middle and high school, this project was later expanded to **include grades K–5** ([Model Math Curricular Resources](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Model-Mathematics-Curriculum.aspx#:~:text=After%20completing%20the%20expectations%20specified,and%203%20high%20school%20courses)). ISBE’s Model Math Curriculum provides **scope-and-sequence units and sample lesson plans** for each grade K–8. For grades 2–4, teachers can access model unit outlines that group the standards into teachable units (in accordance with the PARCC Model Content Frameworks, which Illinois used during Common Core adoption) ([Model Math Curricular Resources](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Model-Mathematics-Curriculum.aspx#:~:text=outlines%20were%20developed%20in%20accordance,2012%20PARCC%20Model%20Content%20Frameworks)) ([Model Math Curricular Resources](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Model-Mathematics-Curriculum.aspx#:~:text=After%20completing%20the%20expectations%20specified,and%203%20high%20school%20courses)). These unit outlines highlight which standards are the major focus and include suggested activities and formative assessment tasks. Additionally, ISBE has offered **“unpacking” documents** via professional development webinars (e.g., the Teacher-to-Teacher series referenced on the ISBE site) to help teachers understand the depth of each standard. Illinois also provides **assessment resources** like the Illinois Assessment of Readiness (IAR) blueprints, which show how the standards are assessed in grades 3–8. While those blueprints are for state testing, they effectively serve as a guide to the critical areas in instruction. Finally, ISBE links to **parent guides** (developed with National PTA) that describe the key learning goals in math for each grade ([Illinois Learning Standards - Oak Park Elementary School District 97](https://www.op97.org/teach-learn/illinois-learning-standards#:~:text=Illinois%20Learning%20Standards%20,you%20will%20begin%20to)), which can help inform curriculum focus and communication.  

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** In Illinois, since the standards are Common Core-based, teaching strategies for grades 2–4 emphasize deep understanding and application. Teachers use techniques like number talks for building mental math fluency, problem-based learning for applying concepts, and math discussions for Practice Standards like critiquing reasoning. The **major work of the grade** is stressed – for example, mastering addition/subtraction in grade 2, multiplication/division in grade 3, and fractions in grade 4 are priority, so instructional time is weighted toward those areas (as reflected in ISBE’s **“Major vs. Supporting Content” guidance in the model curriculum)** ([Model Math Curricular Resources](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Model-Mathematics-Curriculum.aspx#:~:text=high%20school%20courses)). Assessment in grades 2–4 includes both classroom formative assessments and the state assessment (IAR) starting in grade 3. Illinois provides **assessment tools** such as released items from the IAR (formerly PARCC), which teachers in grade 3–4 can use for practice and to understand rigor. Although 2nd grade isn’t tested statewide, many districts use standards-based assessments or interim tests (like NWEA MAP) aligned to the Illinois standards to gauge student progress. The **Illinois Priority Standards** (an initiative post-COVID for learning recovery) also highlight which standards in each grade are most essential; these priorities guide teachers on where to focus if time is constrained ([Standards and Courses](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Standards-Courses.aspx#:~:text=The%20Illinois%20Learning%20Standards%20establish,challenges%20of%20college%20and%20career)) ([Standards and Courses](https://www.isbe.net/Pages/Standards-Courses.aspx#:~:text=,159%20Fine%20Arts)). In summary, Illinois provides a comprehensive framework – from standards to model curriculum to assessment alignment – to ensure that teaching in grades 2–4 is aligned with the rigorous expectations of the Illinois Learning Standards for Mathematics.

# Missouri (Grades 2–4)  
- **Standards Documents:** Missouri’s math standards for grades 2–4 are outlined as **Grade-Level Expectations (GLEs)** in the **Missouri Learning Standards (MLS)** for Math, updated in 2016. These standards were developed as Missouri’s own version of post-Common Core expectations. Each grade’s GLEs cover content strands such as number sense, operations, algebraic thinking, geometry, and data/probability. For example, the 2nd grade expectations include understanding place value to 1000, fluently adding and subtracting within 100, basics of simple time and money, etc., while 4th grade expectations include fluency in multi-digit addition/subtraction, multiplication up to four-digit by one-digit, understanding equivalent fractions and adding/subtracting fractions with like denominators, and classifying geometric figures. The official **MLS Math Standards K–5 document** (available on the Missouri DESE site) presents all these grade-level standards; DESE provides it in PDF and Word formats ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=2017)). Notably, Missouri’s documentation also provides **“Expanded Expectations”** for each grade 2–4 standard ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=%2A%20Grade%201%20,138)). These expanded expectations offer clarification or examples for the GLEs. While Missouri’s standards don’t explicitly reprint the Common Core’s practice standards within the grade expectations, the MLS **do incorporate mathematical practices** – the state expects students to demonstrate problem-solving, reasoning, and other process skills as they engage with the content (Missouri was part of the CCSS development, so the influence of the 8 SMPs is embedded). Missouri also has a coding system for its math GLEs (explained in the standards document) to show the strand/domain and skill.  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) provides several official resources to help teachers with these standards. One key resource is the set of **Expanded Expectations documents** for each grade (linked on the DESE mathematics page) ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=%2A%20Grade%201%20,138)). For instance, a Grade 4 Expanded Expectations document will list each GLE and then expand on it – perhaps by giving a sample problem or noting the depth of knowledge. DESE also released **crosswalk documents** that compare the 2016 MLS to the previous standards, to help educators see what changed ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=Additional%20Resources)). Moreover, Missouri has identified **Priority Standards** – as indicated on the DESE site, “priority standards and resources” were released to support learning acceleration ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=Math%20Priority%20Standards)). These highlight the most essential GLEs at each grade 2–4 (for example, fluency with multiplication facts in grade 3 might be labeled a priority). In terms of curriculum, Missouri does not mandate a single curriculum, but DESE’s **Math Curriculum units** (developed in partnership with Missouri educators) are often available through workshops or the DESE website. They sometimes provide sample unit plans or performance tasks. Another resource on the DESE site is the **Math Learning Progressions** and **Vertical Alignments**, which show how a concept (like fractions) progresses from grade 2 through grade 5, helping teachers connect their grade’s work to prior and future learning. 

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** Missouri encourages instructional strategies that foster understanding and mastery of the GLEs. Teachers in grades 2–4 are guided to use manipulatives and representations (for instance, using place value blocks for addition in grade 2, fraction strips in grade 4) and to regularly incorporate math discussions aligning with mathematical practices. The state’s **assessment guidelines** for these grades come from the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP). The **MAP Grade-Level Assessments** in math (starting at grade 3) are directly aligned to the MLS GLEs. DESE publishes **assessment blueprints** for each tested grade which indicate the number of items per domain/strand ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=,176)). For example, the 3rd grade blueprint might show a heavier emphasis on operations and algebraic thinking and numbers/base ten. These blueprints, along with **Performance Level Descriptors (PLDs)** that DESE provides for each grade level test, serve as important guides for teachers: they detail what proficient performance looks like on each group of standards. Additionally, DESE offers **Grade 3 and 4 Math Practice Forms** (released practice tests) with an answer key and scoring guide ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=Math%20Practice%20Forms)) ([Mathematics | Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education](https://dese.mo.gov/college-career-readiness/curriculum/mathematics#:~:text=)). Teachers use these practice tests to familiarize students with the format and rigor of state assessments. In daily instruction, Missouri teachers often create formative assessments aligned to each GLE (sometimes using items from released MAP tests). The focus is on ensuring students not only can get answers correct but can also explain their reasoning – a reflection of embedding the Standards for Mathematical Practice into teaching, though Missouri names them within the context of the GLEs (for instance, a GLE might implicitly require MP.4 by having students model a problem situation). Overall, Missouri’s official materials (standards, expanded expectations, priority standards, and assessment tools) provide a comprehensive framework for teaching and evaluating math in grades 2–4.

# Arizona (Grades 2–4)  
- **Standards Documents:** Arizona’s math standards for grades 2–4 are outlined in the **Arizona Mathematics Standards** (adopted December 2016). These standards were Arizona’s revision of the Common Core, tailored to state preferences. They define the knowledge and skills Arizona expects in each grade. For grade 2, this includes extending understanding of place value (to 1000), fluently adding and subtracting within 100, using units of measure and data representations, and describing shapes. Grade 3 standards introduce multiplication and division concepts, fractions as part of a whole, and broader area/perimeter and geometry topics. Grade 4 standards emphasize multi-digit arithmetic (including fluently adding/subtracting multi-digit numbers and multiplying multi-digit numbers), deeper fraction understanding (equivalence, addition/subtraction with like denominators, multiplying a whole number by a fraction), and classifying geometric figures by properties ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=nearest%20hundred%20thousand%2C%20which%20builds,digit)) ([](https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/stateboardofeducation/documents/massivemeetingsfolder/meetingfiles3/4-15-16_V_A_Math_Standards_Attachment.pdf#:~:text=Students%20continue%20to%20develop%20an,contextual%20problems%20involving%20addition%20and)). The Arizona Mathematics Standards documents are available by grade level; each grade has a PDF with the standards listed, and an introduction that often lists the **Standards for Mathematical Practice**. Arizona explicitly includes the same eight Mathematical Practices (MP1–MP8) in its standards – the grade-level documents list these at the beginning, indicating that these practices should be developed alongside content learning ([](https://cms.azed.gov/home/GetDocumentFile?id=58546ee7aadebe13008c1a1d#:~:text=Standards%20for%20Mathematical%20Practices%20,and%20critique%20the%20reasoning%20of)). The official Arizona standards also contain an introduction explaining how to read the standards and the importance of conceptual understanding, fluency, and application ([Standards: Mathematics | Arizona Department of Education](https://www.azed.gov/standards-practices/k-12standards/mathematics-standards#:~:text=The%20Arizona%20Mathematics%20Standards%20define,of%20Education%20in%20December%202016)).  

- **Curriculum Guides & Resources:** The Arizona Dept. of Education (ADE) has provided additional resources to support the 2016 math standards. Notably, ADE developed **Mathematics Progression Documents** for each grade K–5 ([Standards: Mathematics | Arizona Department of Education](https://www.azed.gov/standards-practices/k-12standards/mathematics-standards#:~:text=PROGRESSION%20DOCUMENTS%20K,updating%295th%20Grade)). These progression documents describe how key concepts evolve from one grade to the next and highlight connections (for example, how the understanding of base-ten in grade 2 links to expanded multiplication in grade 4). They are useful for curriculum mapping and ensuring coherence. Arizona also created **Content Emphasis documents** (sometimes called “placemats”) which identify the major, supporting, and additional clusters of standards for each grade – guiding teachers on where to spend the most instructional time. In addition, on the official standards page, Arizona provides a **Glossary** for terms in the standards and an **introductory guidance document** (with rationale and instructional shifts). For curriculum planning, while Arizona allows districts to choose their materials, the state has offered resources like the **Arizona Academic Standards Case** portal ([Standards: Mathematics | Arizona Department of Education](https://www.azed.gov/standards-practices/k-12standards/mathematics-standards#:~:text=Access%C2%A0PAASport)), which is an online tool to navigate the standards. Teachers can also find **sample tasks and lesson ideas** aligned to Arizona’s standards through the Arizona Digital Educator’s Library (ADEL) and other state-supported platforms. 

- **Teaching Strategies & Assessment:** Arizona’s math standards encourage teaching for understanding, similar to Common Core but with clarity adjustments. Teachers in grades 2–4 use strategies like number sense routines (e.g., daily practice with place value or math facts), problem-based learning (solving real-world word problems that require the targeted skills), and math discourse. The **Standards for Mathematical Practice** in Arizona are expected to be integrated – for instance, students might **“attend to precision” (MP6)** by using correct place value language, or **“model with mathematics” (MP4)** by representing a word problem with equations or drawings. The Arizona state math assessment (AzM2, which transitioned to **AASA – Arizona’s Academic Standards Assessment** in 2022) is aligned to the 2016 standards. ADE publishes **assessment blueprints** that indicate how many items on the test come from each standard cluster ([[PDF] AASA Math Blueprint 2016 Standards](https://www.azed.gov/sites/default/files/2021/10/Math%20AzM2%20Blueprint%202016%20Standards_AASA%20Oct%202021.pdf#:~:text=,Operations%20in%20Base%20Ten)). For example, the Grade 3 AASA blueprint shows the weight given to operations and base-ten understanding versus fractions, which signals teachers to those priority areas. Additionally, Arizona has released **sample test questions** and a formative assessment item bank tied to the standards. In the classroom, teachers assess students via performance tasks (many drawn from ADE’s resources or Achieve’s tasks) that require explaining reasoning – reflecting Arizona’s emphasis on both getting the answer and understanding the process. Professional development provided by the state (often through the AZ Math Professional Learning series) also shares effective strategies like the use of math learning centers, visual models for fractions, and methods for building fact fluency, all aligned with Arizona’s content and practice standards ([Standards: Mathematics | Arizona Department of Education](https://www.azed.gov/standards-practices/k-12standards/mathematics-standards#:~:text=)) ([Standards: Mathematics | Arizona Department of Education](https://www.azed.gov/standards-practices/k-12standards/mathematics-standards#:~:text=The%20Arizona%20Mathematics%20Standards%20define,of%20Education%20in%20December%202016)). The combination of clearly-defined standards, support documents, and aligned assessments helps Arizona teachers maintain fidelity to the standards for grades 2–4.
