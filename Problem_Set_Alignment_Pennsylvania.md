|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “John had 8 candies, he eats 3 of them. How many candies does he have now?” | **CC.2.2.1.A.1** – Represent and solve addition and subtraction within 20 | This problem asks students to subtract 3 from 8 to find the remainder, which is a straightforward **subtraction within 10** (and within 20). It builds number sense by having students remove part of a quantity to find the result, directly addressing the ability to **solve an addition or subtraction word problem within 20**. | **John has 8 apples. He eats 3 of them. How many apples does John have left?** (Students solve 8 – 3 using objects or drawings.) |
| “There are 8 children around the table for Dorothy’s birthday, and 3 of them are drinking juice. How many are not drinking juice?” | **CC.2.2.1.A.1** – Addition and subtraction within 20 <br> *(Also builds understanding of part-whole relationships in a total of 8)* | This task involves a **part-whole scenario**: from 8 total children, 3 have juice and the rest do not. Students must interpret the subtraction 8 – 3 = 5, practicing **taking apart** a total. It reinforces number sense by understanding that the total minus one part gives the other part. This aligns with solving addition/subtraction problems within 20 in a real-world context. | **At a party, 8 children sit at a table. 3 children are drinking juice. How many children are not drinking juice?** (Students recognize 8 total, 3 with juice, so 5 without.) |
| “Juanita has just been given $3 by her grandmother. She now has $8. How many dollars did she have before?” | **CC.2.2.1.A.1** – Addition/subtraction within 20 <br> **CC.2.2.1.A.2** – Understand relationship between addition and subtraction | This problem is a **“start unknown” addition scenario**: an initial amount plus 3 equals 8. Students must infer the starting amount by **subtracting** 3 from 8. Solving it demonstrates the relationship between addition and subtraction (using subtraction to undo addition). It aligns with first grade expectations by requiring **addition/subtraction within 20** and understanding that an unknown addend can be found via subtraction. | **Juanita had some stickers. Her grandma gave her 3 more, and now she has 8 stickers in total. How many did she have to start with?** (Students realize the initial amount = 8 – 3.) |
| “Robert had 8 marbles before playing with Ruth. He now has 3 marbles. What has happened during the game?” | **CC.2.2.1.A.1** – Addition/subtraction within 20 | This problem implies a **decrease scenario**: Robert’s marbles went from 8 down to 3. Students determine that he **lost 5 marbles**, effectively performing the subtraction 8 – 5 = 3. This meets the standard of solving an addition/subtraction problem within 20, and it builds understanding of subtraction as describing a loss or take-away in context. (The open question “What happened?” encourages reasoning that a subtraction occurred, even if phrased qualitatively.) | **Robert had 8 marbles. After playing a game, he has 3 marbles. How many marbles did he lose during the game?** (Students subtract 8 – 3 to find that 5 marbles were lost.) |
| “Susan has $3 in her pocket. Claire has $8. How much less does Susan have?” | **CC.2.2.1.A.1** – Addition/subtraction within 20 <br> **CC.2.2.1.A.2** – Relationship between addition and subtraction | This is a **comparison problem** asking for the difference between two quantities (3 and 8). Students figure out “how much less” by computing 8 – 3 = 5. It reinforces that subtraction can be used to compare two numbers, aligning with the standard of solving problems within 20. Understanding that the difference can be found by subtracting the smaller from the larger number also reflects the **relationship between addition and subtraction** (as the inverse operations that connect two values and their difference). | **Susan has 3 marbles and Claire has 8 marbles. How many more marbles does Claire have than Susan?** (Students either count up from 3 to 8 or do 8 – 3 = 5 to find the difference of 5 marbles.) |
| “Ally played two games of marbles. In the second game she won 3 marbles. She does not remember what happened in the first game. But when she counts her marbles she finds that she has won 8 marbles in all. How many marbles did she win in the first game?” | **CC.2.2.1.A.1** – Addition/subtraction within 20 <br> **CC.2.2.1.A.2** – Relationship between addition and subtraction | This multi-step context has students interpret a total gain spread over two events: the sum of marbles won in game 1 and game 2 is 8 (with game 2 contributing 3). To find the unknown first-game winnings, students set up **3 + □ = 8** and solve by **subtracting 3 from 8**. This aligns with representing and solving addition problems within 20. It also highlights the **concept of an unknown addend**, reinforcing the understanding of subtraction as the inverse of addition (finding the missing part of a sum). | **Ally won some marbles in the first game and 3 marbles in the second game. Together, she won 8 marbles in both games. How many marbles did Ally win in the first game?** (Students solve 3 + ___ = 8, so the answer is 5 marbles.) |
| *No direct original given (place-value comparison)* – **Example:** “(Place value) Compare 24 and 42. Who has more?” | **CC.2.1.1.B.2** – Use place-value concepts to represent tens and ones and to compare two-digit numbers | This problem addresses **number sense and place value**. By comparing 24 vs 42 in a story context, students must use their understanding of tens and ones to identify which number is larger. This meets the first grade standard of comparing two-digit numbers using place-value knowledge. It reinforces that the number of tens is the determining factor when comparing two-digit numbers (42 has more tens than 24). | **Tom picked 24 apples, and Sally picked 42 apples. Who picked more apples? How do you know?** (Students recognize that 42 > 24 because 42 has 4 tens vs 2 tens, so Sally picked more.) |
| *No direct original given (shape composition)* – **Example:** “(Geometry) Compose shapes” | **CC.2.3.1.A.1** – Compose and distinguish between two- and three-dimensional shapes based on their attributes | This task engages students in **geometry and spatial reasoning** by having them combine simple shapes to form a composite shape. It aligns with the standard to *compose shapes* and recognize attributes. By putting two shapes together and identifying the result (e.g., two triangles making a square or a rectangle made of two smaller squares), students learn to distinguish shapes and see how larger shapes can be built from smaller components – a key first grade geometric concept. | **Emma has two identical triangle blocks. She fits them together to make a new shape with four sides. What shape does she make?** (Students realize two right triangles can form a rectangle or square, illustrating composition of a larger 2D shape.) |
| *No direct original given (partitioning shapes)* – **Example:** “(Geometry – halves/quarters)” | **CC.2.3.1.A.2** – Partition shapes into halves and quarters (using understanding of fractions) | This problem targets the **introduction to fractions through geometry**. It asks students to divide a shape or set into equal parts, directly addressing the standard of partitioning shapes into halves and quarters. By identifying halves and quarters in a familiar context (like pieces of a candy bar or pie), students grasp that equal shares of a whole are called halves (2 parts) or quarters (4 parts). This builds early fraction sense in a concrete, age-appropriate way. | **Sam has a chocolate bar made of 4 equal pieces. He breaks it into 2 equal groups of pieces. Did he split the chocolate into halves or quarters? How do you know?** (Students see 2 equal groups out of 4 pieces means each group is half of the bar. They recognize halves vs. quarters based on how many equal parts make the whole.) |

Each reformulated problem maintains the spirit of the original task while ensuring the context, numbers, and concepts are suitable for 1st graders. The alignment notes clarify how each problem meets Pennsylvania’s 1st grade standards, covering essential domains: **Number & Operations in Base Ten** (place value and comparing numbers), **Algebraic Concepts** (basic addition and subtraction word problems, understanding the inverse relationship), **Geometry** (shape composition and partitioning into equal parts), and **Measurement/Data** (implicitly touched through real-world contexts and comparisons). This balanced set of problems aims to reinforce first graders’ number sense, operational skills, early algebraic thinking, geometric reasoning, and problem-solving abilities in line with state standards.
