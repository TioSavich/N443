|---|---|---|---|
| *How Many Cups?* The first three cups are 8.1 cm, 7.6 cm, and 7.1 cm tall. The last cup is 2.6 cm tall. How many of the last cups would equal the height of the first three cups combined? | 4.MD.A.2 – Solve one- or two-step measurement word problems ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20%23%23%23%23%204.MD.A.2%20Solve%20one,a%20single%20system%20of%20measurement)) | This problem involves adding three lengths and then determining how many of a fourth length make up that total. It is a two-step real-world problem (addition followed by division) involving measurements of length, aligning with 4.MD.A.2’s focus on multi-step measurement problems ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20%23%23%23%23%204.MD.A.2%20Solve%20one,a%20single%20system%20of%20measurement)). Students must perform operations within a single measurement system and reason about equal units, which is appropriate for 4th-grade number operations in context. | **Reformulated:** Three cups have heights of **8** cm, **7** cm, and **7** cm. Another type of cup is **2** cm tall. If you stack the three taller cups, how many of the **2** cm cups would make a stack of the same height? |
| *Candy Comparison:* Brother had **3** candies, Sister had **6** candies. How many times as much candy did Sister have as Brother? | 4.OA.A.2 – Multiply or divide to solve multiplicative comparisons ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,multiplicative%20comparison%20from%20additive%20comparison)) | This question asks “how many times as many,” exemplifying a multiplicative comparison (6 is 2 times 3). It directly addresses 4.OA.A.2 ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,multiplicative%20comparison%20from%20additive%20comparison)), which expects students to solve word problems involving multiplicative comparison and distinguish them from additive comparisons. The problem reinforces understanding of “times as many” in a simple context suitable for 4th graders. | **Reformulated:** (Same as original) Brother has **3** candies and Sister has **6** candies. How many times as many candies does Sister have as Brother? |
| *Taller Siblings:* Brother A is **140** cm tall and Sister A is **80** cm tall. Brother B is **150** cm tall. Brother A stands **10 cm** taller over his sister than Brother B stands over his sister. How tall is Sister B? | 4.OA.A.3 – Solve multi-step word problems with whole numbers ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20%23%23%23%23%204.OA.A.3%20Solve%20multi,standing%20for%20the%20unknown%20quantity)) | This is a multi-step problem involving comparisons and subtraction. Students must first find how much taller Brother A is than Sister A (60 cm) and understand that Brother B’s height difference should be **10 cm** less. They then subtract to find Sister B’s height. This aligns with 4.OA.A.3 ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20%23%23%23%23%204.OA.A.3%20Solve%20multi,standing%20for%20the%20unknown%20quantity)), requiring multiple operations and use of a letter or placeholder for the unknown. It also involves interpreting the result in context (a realistic scenario). | **Reformulated:** (Same as original) Brother A is **140** cm tall and Sister A is **80** cm tall. Brother B is **150** cm tall. Brother A is **10 cm** more above his sister than Brother B is above his sister. How tall is Sister B? |
| *Pizza Fractions:* Alice had 3/4 of a pizza. She gave 1/4 of the pizza to her brother and another 1/4 to her friend. How much of the pizza does Alice have left? | 4.NF.B.3.d – Solve word problems involving fraction addition/subtraction ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,whole%20and%20having%20like%20denominators)) | This problem has students subtract fractional parts of a whole (with like denominators). Starting with 3/4 and removing two 1/4 pieces taps into 4.NF.B.3.d ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,whole%20and%20having%20like%20denominators)), which focuses on solving word problems with fractions that refer to the same whole and have like denominators. It reinforces fraction subtraction in a familiar context (parts of a pizza), a key 4th-grade fractions skill. | **Reformulated:** (Same as original) Alice had **3/4** of a pizza. She gave **1/4** of the pizza to her brother and **1/4** to her friend. How much of the pizza does she have left? |
| *Fabric Project:* Each student needs 3/4 of a yard of fabric for a project. If there are 5 students, how many yards of fabric are needed in total? | 4.NF.B.4.c – Solve word problems multiplying a whole number by a fraction ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,equations%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)) | Students must find the total fabric for 5 students, each using 3/4 yard. This is a multiplication of a whole number by a fraction (5 × 3/4), aligning with standard 4.NF.B.4.c ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,equations%20to%20represent%20the%20problem)). It requires understanding fraction multiplication as repeated addition or combining fractional parts, an important 4th-grade skill (resulting in 3 3/4 yards). | **Reformulated:** (Same as original) Each student needs **3/4** of a yard of fabric for a project. If there are **5** students, how many yards of fabric are needed in total? |
| *Growing Dots:* In a dot pattern, Step 1 has 1 dot, Step 2 has 3 dots, Step 3 has 6 dots, and so on. Marcy wants to find out how many dots will be in Step 20 without drawing all the steps. | 4.OA.C.5 – Generate and analyze patterns with a given rule ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,explicit%20in%20the%20rule%20itself)) | This pattern grows by an increasing number of dots each step (e.g., +2, +3, +4,…). Finding the 20th step challenges students to recognize the pattern and generalize it. This addresses 4.OA.C.5 ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,explicit%20in%20the%20rule%20itself)), which involves identifying and extending patterns and noticing features not explicitly stated (such as the n<sup>th</sup> term or the pattern of differences). The task fosters algebraic thinking at a 4th-grade level by exploring a numeric pattern in context. | **Reformulated:** (Same as original) In a dot pattern, Step 1 has **1** dot, Step 2 has **3** dots, Step 3 has **6** dots, and so on. How can Marcy figure out how many dots will be in Step **20** without drawing all the steps? |
| *Coin Flips:* How many different outcomes (sequences of heads and tails) are possible if you flip a coin 2 times? 3 times? 4 times? Can you find a pattern or rule and predict the number of outcomes for 5 coin flips? | 4.OA.C.5 – Generate and analyze patterns with a given rule ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,explicit%20in%20the%20rule%20itself)) | This problem invites students to enumerate outcomes for a growing number of coin flips and look for a pattern. As the number of flips increases, the outcomes double each time (2, 4, 8, 16,…). Recognizing this rule (“each additional flip doubles the outcomes”) aligns with 4.OA.C.5 ([IXL - Tennessee fourth-grade math standards](https://www.ixl.com/standards/tennessee/math/grade-4#:~:text=%2A%20,explicit%20in%20the%20rule%20itself)). Students identify a numeric pattern and articulate the rule governing it, a key aspect of 4th-grade algebraic thinking and pattern analysis. | **Reformulated:** (Same as original) How many different outcomes (heads/tails sequences) are possible if you flip a coin **2** times? **3** times? **4** times? What pattern do you notice, and how many outcomes would there be for **5** flips? |
